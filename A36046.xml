         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Clear and Learned Explication OF THE HISTORY OF OUR BLESSED SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>MAthew begins ſaying, <hi>The Book of the Nativity of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Mathew ſaid not as the Prophets, that the Lord ſaid unto me, or I ſaw a Viſion, for, by reaſon that the Jews were carried about after falſe Prophets, it behoved them to ſay ſo, but Mathew, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as he wrote to the faithful, he needed not to have imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the Prophets, nor did he put his Name to the Book be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wrote to thoſe who were near at hand, after the manner of a Narrative. Yet Paul becauſe he wrote to thoſe who were afar off, he wrote in the manner of an Epiſtle, and therefore it was neceſſary to put his Name thereunto, he calls the Book <hi>the Book of Nativity,</hi> becauſe the Nativity of our Saviour is the ſource of all Bleſſings, or even as Moſes names his Book from the <hi>Creation</hi> whil'ſt he Treats of ſuch other things as were tranſacted and performed in the World for the ſpace of two thouſand, two hundred and ſixteen years, and calls another Book by the name of going out, yet wrote therein of other things, ſo it is called the book of Generation, by reaſon that this is the principal matter, that God ſhould be born in the Fleſh; tho' he treats of the reſt of his Converſation on Earth, for it is the principal part, as being the beſt part that gives Denomination, ſay the Philoſophers; and although Baptiſm be the begining of the Goſpel, yet he commenceth from the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37030:8"/>Nativity, that he might inſtruct the Hebrews, that this was the Meſſiah whom God had promiſed to Abraham, and David, that he ſhould ſpring out of their Seed, and that he was the Giver of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nativity</hi> is ſpoken in many ſences; Firſt, as from a Woman. Secondly, as from Baptiſm; according to that, <hi>he who is not born of Water and the Spirit;</hi> Thirdly, from the Grave; <hi>who hath heard ſuch a thing, who hath ſeen ſuch things, that the Earth ſhould bring forth in one day, or that a Nation ſhould be born in one hour?</hi> Fourthly, Nativity is ſaid alſo of things remote from the Birth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſa.</hi> 66.8.</note> according to this;<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15.</note> 
               <hi>for in Jeſus Chriſt I have begotten you,</hi> and <hi>he was pleaſed to beget us in the Spirit,</hi> and, <hi>I know not what to morrow is to bring forth,</hi> and, <hi>who hath begotten the drops of Rain,</hi> and, <hi>he Travelleth with Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>

                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 38.28. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.14.</note> 
               <hi>and hath conceived falſehood, and brought forth De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, as the beam and ſplendor which is begotten of the Sun, or fire, and as the Eternity of the Son is begotten of the Father according to the Divine Nature, but here he doth not ſpeak of the Eternal Generation from the Father, but of the Temporal from the Virgin, and tho' it be called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the birth of Abel and Jacob, yet it is not there ſaid of any of the Fathers, the book of the Nativity, except of Chriſt, to the end, that we may take notice, that Chriſt, is not meer Man, but God, made Man. And, that he was not born ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinary Courſe of Humane Nature, of Father, and Mother, but Supernaturally of the Holy Ghoſt, and the bleſſed Virgin.</p>
            <p>Moreover, he begins at the Genealogies, to ſignifie, that although Chriſt was reputed by the Jews to be the Son of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, yet they were not perſwaded of his Eternal Sonſhip; yet of Joſeph there was ſome doubt, whether he were the Son of David or not; and this is accurately made known by the Genealogies, and the doubt Reſolved.</p>
            <p>The Greek hath it, <hi>the Book of making,</hi> or being, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or being is ſaid to be nine fold; Firſt, when of nothing, ſomething is made; as the Heaven and Earth were made of nothing. Secondly, when of ſomething ſomething was made;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37030:8"/>as the Firmament, and Trees were made of ſomething. Thirdly, by way of Contempt, as God ſaid, <hi>Adam is made as one of us.</hi> Fourthly, by way of Tranſmutation, <hi>as Lots Wife was made a Pillar of Salt.</hi> Fifthly, Imperſonally, <hi>the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the Morning were the firſt day.</hi> Sixthly, by way of help, or aſſiſtance, as, <hi>the Lord was with</hi> Moſes. Seventhly, Temporally, <hi>and I was as one who heareth not.</hi> Eightly, Of Grace; according to that, <hi>Moſes was a God with Pharaoh.</hi> Ninthly, Without Tranſmutation, when one is become that which he was not before; ſo was Abel a Herdſman, and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid a King and a Prophet, and Aaron a Prieſt, without chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humane Nature from what it was; and thus we ſay, <hi>The Word of God was made Man,</hi> God being not changed in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Son of David, the Son of Abraham;</hi> he calls him not the Son of Joſeph, becauſe he had not to do in his Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; neither doth he call him the Son of Mary, although he was made Fleſh by her, it being not agreeable to the cuſtom of Scripture to compute Genealogies from Women; but he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions David and Abraham, becauſe the beginning of his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Chiſt is referred to them: For he ſaid unto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the Natious of the Earth be bleſſed:</hi> And unto David, <hi>Thy Children ſhall ſit upon the Throne for ever.</hi> And to ſhew unto the Hebrews, that he deſcended from David, as the Prophets had foretold.</p>
            <p>Moreover he calls him the Son of David, thereby to raiſe the greater eſteem of him; he was a Nazarite becauſe nurſed in Nazareth, according to what Philip ſaid unto Nathaniel, <hi>We have found Jeſus of Nazareth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Promiſe was made unto Abraham, becauſe he was the firſt who was converted from Idolatry. It was alſo made unto David, foraſmuch as he was the firſt King who kept the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and for that he pleaſed God, and brought up the Ark, and was deſirous to build a houſe unto the Lord. He ſets David before Abraham, by reaſon of his Kingdom, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and the Renown of his Time; for the Fame of his Deeds were celebrated in the mouth of all men, and from him they expected that Chriſt ſhould ariſe; according to that, <hi>Was it not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37030:9"/>from the ſeed of David, and from Bethlehem, that Chriſt was to ſpring?</hi> And they called all good Kings which ruled over them by the Name of David, as, <hi>David my Servant ſhall rule them;</hi> and, <hi>I will ſet over them David my ſervant:</hi> And it was with an oath ſaid unto David, <hi>The Lord ſwore unto David in truth, and will not repent, Of the fruit of thy Belly.</hi> And, <hi>I have ſworn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to David my ſervant;</hi> and, <hi>A Rod ſhall ſprout out of the Root of Jeſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, he placeth David before Abraham, becauſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made unto Abraham, was, That he ſhould be <hi>Father of Nations;</hi> but it was promiſed unto David, That Chriſt the Redeemer ſhould ſpring out of his Seed; and it was meet that he from whoſe Seed Chriſt the Redeemer was to come, ſhould be preferred to him who was Chief of the Nations: For the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer is more to be eſteemed than they who are Redeemed. For this cauſe it is that he mentions Abraham after David, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe unto him was the Promiſe of calling the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Son of Abraham;</hi> that is to ſay, He calls Chriſt the Son of Abraham according to the fleſh; but he neither calls him the Son of David nor of Abraham, as of Marital Conjunction, but according to Genealogy and Deſcent; and he whom Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew calls <hi>the Son of David,</hi> Mark calls <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and Luke <hi>the Power of the moſt High,</hi> and John the <hi>Word of God;</hi> but he was called God, and the Word, and the Power of the moſt High, becauſe he was ſo, and he was named the Son of David and of Abraham, for that he was made ſo; and he was one and the very ſame, and not different Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham begat Iſaac;</hi> he ſets down this Genealogy to ſhew that Chriſt came, as God formerly had promiſed to Abraham and to David, and that he was the Meſſiah expected by the Jews, and that they were inexcuſable if they would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſaac begat Jacob, Jacob begat Jadah and his brethren:</hi> He did not mention the Brethren of Iſaac and Jacob, becauſe they had no Commerce with the Stock of Iſrael, for they were Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and the Sons of Iſhmael, Arabians, and Edomites, and not by reaſon of their being wicked, as others ſay; for the Scripture mentioneth thoſe who were more wicked than they.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37030:9"/>He mentioneth the Brethren of Judah, becauſe that from his Lineage is derived the Genealogy of Chriſt, who was of the Seed of David.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judah begat Pharez and Zarah of Thamar;</hi> He mentions Thamar who was of the Gentiles, and was guilty of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; hereby we are inſtructed of the Mercy and Goodneſs of God, who was not only made Man, but was born from ſuch-like Anceſtors as theſe; and by reaſon all men were brought under the yoke of Sin, there was a neceſsity of his coming upon earth; and if Judah ſinned, and David committed Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, how much more was the tranſgreſsion of others? He by his coming abſolved thoſe who were under the reproach of guilt, and his Goſpel accepted of every Believer, Adulterers, Fornicators, and as many of all ſorts as were Penitents. And it was for our Conſolation that he made mention of Thamar, that we ſhould not be aſhamed of our wicked Anceſtors, but be comforted by the Vertue, Pulchritude, and Ornaments of our own minds; for a man is not ſcandaliz'd by evil Parents; for if a Fornicatrix be converted into vertuous habits, her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer evil manners will be no reproach unto her: How much leſs reproach is it to a man to have been the Son of a Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, or the Adultery or Sins of his Fore-fathers, if his own Manners do not reproach him?</p>
            <p>Moreover, he mentioneth Thamar to reprove the Jews, who boaſted of Abraham, and yet were deſtitute of a good Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; as if he had ſaid unto them, Behold, ſhe who commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Fornication was the Mother of David.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, we ſay, That Thamar did not ſit there with a purpoſe of Fornication; and it is manifeſt from what Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah ſaid, <hi>She hath been more righteous than I;</hi> but that ſhe might miniſter to the Generation of our Saviour Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gen. 32.26.</note> who was concealed in Judah, and this is known from hence, that ſhe did thus with him, and no other man; and thus ſhe did after the death of his Wife, that ſhe might not ſeem to offend, for the Law was not then written which prohibited the ſame.</p>
            <p>Again, ſhe had the greater proclivity in her affections to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, in regard of his want of Children, for deſtitution of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren was reputed a diſgrace to every man.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:37030:10"/>
            <p>Moreover, Thamar prefigured the Church and the Gentiles, who committed Fornication with Idols, and by the off-ſpring of Thamar were redeemed.</p>
            <p>Thamar was of the off-ſpring of the Gentiles, ſo alſo was the Church; Thamar committed Fornication, ſo likewiſe did the Church commit Fornication with Idols; and as Thamar was mixed in the Genealogy of Chriſt, ſo was the Church made a parcipitant of the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thamar is expounded the Church, as calling Chriſt unto her <gap reason="foreign">

Zarah ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the Eaſt, they appeared in the light of Gods Worſhip as Enoch, Shem, Japheth, and Melchizedech, and he ſprouting out for a while, and ſtretching forth the hand, their place was contracted, and as it were a certain partition was made</p>
            <p>Secondly, Moſes is hereby hinted, who came between, for when Zarah drew back his hand; there was a partition like to an Hedg, and Pharez came forth, that is to ſay, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation by Moſes, which Paul calleth a partition Wall, and Pharez is expounded an hedg, partition, or diviſion; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him came again the diſpenſation of the Goſpel; and it was Zarah, who caſt the firſt beams of Light into the World at the firſt, and yet came laſt into it. Zarah therefore prefigured the Gentiles, and Pharez prefigured the people of the Jews, and as Zarah ſhewed his hand, and afterwards withdrew it; ſo alſo a New People; and the Inſtitutions of Moſes ſhewed themſelves in the days of Noah, and Abraham, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards drew back, and the People, and Rites of Moſes Entred, as Pharez was born firſt, and afterwards a New People ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and as Zarah, who was born after Pharez, our Saviour ſprang from Pharez as to the fleſh.</p>

               <hi>Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab;</hi> He mentioneth Rahab to ſhew, that Chriſt came not as a Judg to Puniſh, but to Cure our Iniquities; and as he took an Harlot, ſo God Eſpouſed a Nature which went a Whoring after Idols, and clave there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, teaching us, that he admits of ſuch as are Penitent.</p>
            <p>Rahab is Expounded an Aſſociation of Gentiles, and of Gods peculiar People.</p>

               <hi>David begat Solomon of the Wife of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi> he brings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to remembrance the Wife of Uriah, thereby ſignifying, that he was not aſhamed to write the Truth, and to declare the Sin of David, who by means of the Goſpel, and the deſcent of a Phyſitian who had no Sin, was Cured, and freed therefrom; and from the Murther of Uriah; for when David increaſed in Vertue, and became Eminent, he immediately obtained Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by him.</p>
            <p>He alſo committed Adultery with Bethſhebah, but he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, and Wept, whereupon it was Revealed unto him,<note place="margin">Pſal. 132.9.</note> that the Lord ſhould come and heal him from Sin; and when he enquired concerning the place of his Son, he ſaid, <hi>I will give no Sleep to my Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. and after he received the Promiſe of God concerning this; he ſpake, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 29th and the 16th, concerning the condeſcention of a Phyſitian even to Death, who ſaved the Souls of Sinners; and if any one ſhall be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that David Sinned, let him take notice, that he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this one Sin, the whole time of his long Reign; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he offered a long, laſting, and a great repentance; and he was permitted to fall into Sin, that he might be a good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for Sinners to repent as he did; and therefore he made Solomon to Reign in his ſtead, that all Men might know, that his Sin was remitted, and that the Jews might not conceive that Solomon was a baſtard, as was the other Boy whom God ſmote, and he dyed.</p>

Some do relate, that Affricanus Biſhops of Emaus ſaith, the reaſon was, becauſe they were Sinners of the Seed of Jezabel, unto whom we ſay, that they were not of the Seed of Jezabel, for Jezebel was the Wife of Achab, but Joram took to Wife Atalia the Daughter of Omri, the Siſter of Achab, and of her begat Achaziah, although in one place, according to the ſenſe of the Septuagint ſhe is called the Daughter of Achab, by a miſtake riſing from the ſimilitude of Writing, according to the Expoſition of Severus, and the Mother of Jeoaſh was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Thoba, of Berſheba, and of Amotſia, Jehoadan, which were of Hieruſalem; wherefore they were not of the Seed of Jezabel, nor were they greater Sinners than Solomon, Achaz, and Manaſſe, who are Written. Saint Severus ſaith, that Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram the Son of Joſhephat took Athalia, the Daughter of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab, and of her begat Achazia and Joaſh, and Amotſia, whom Mathew omitted, becauſe the Jews held in abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Idolaters of the Houſe of Achab; and for this reaſon it was, that he was ſilent as to thoſe who were born in Idolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrical Marriage, remembring this, <hi>That Puniſh the Sins of the Fathers upon the Children, unto the third and fourth Gene ration, of them who hate me;</hi> unto whom ſome ſay, That A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaliah the Wife of Joram, and Mother of Achazia, was not the Daughter of Achab, but the Daughter of Omri, and the Siſter of Achab, and if out of regard to the Hebrews he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore to ſpeak of thoſe who came from Athalia, how cometh <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">

            <p>Origen ſaith, that he therefore left out theſe, that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations from David to the Captivity might be adjuſted to the Number fourteen, for thrice fourteen Generations amount to forty and two; and it is a Figure ſignifying, that as at the end of forty two Progreſſions, the people of Iſrael inherited the Land of Promiſe; ſo at the end of forty two Generations, Chriſt aroſe, and gave the Inheritance of the Temporal Earth to the Saints. <hi>Georgius de Gentibus</hi> ſaith, That Mathew did not omit theſe three perſons, nor did he change the Number of the Generations, nor ſaid <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> fourteen inſtead of ſeventeen; but foraſmuch as he wrote his Goſpel to the Jews, many of whom were skilful in the Greek Tongue, and deſirous to Tranſlate it out of Hebrew into Greek, and the Greek Tongue could not expreſs the Letters of their Names Cheth, Aign, and Tſadi, according to the pronunciation of the Hebrew, and Syriack Language, and that it hath not in its Alphabet guttural Letters, deeply ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Throat; ſo that the Interpreters when they came to Joram, the Words being, that he begat Achaſia, and he begat Jehoaſh, and he begat Amotſia, and Amotſia begat Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia; they wrote the Names thus, that Joram begat Achoſia, and Achoſia Joaſh, and Joaſh Amoſia, and Amoſia Oſia: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who followed them coming to Write the Goſpel in Greek, began from hence, that Joram begat Achoſia, and that Joram begat Oſia, by reaſon of ſimilitude of Names, and the variation of them in the one Letter Coph; and this perhaps they did unwillingly, or willingly to Adapt their Genealogie to four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Generations, for thoſe of the Jews who believed were mightily taken with the Number ſeven and fourteen; and ſo the Syriack Copies were derived unto all Nations.</p>
            <p>But we Anſwer him thus; This is not true, and if it had been an Errour, or miſtake of the Writer, and Mathew himſelf had not left out thoſe Names; then Mathew muſt have ſaid, that from David to the tranſmigration had been ſeventeen Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37030:12"/>but for as much as Mathew wrote afterwards four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Generations, we underſtand that Mathew omitted them. Others ſay, that the Hebrew Chriſtians put theſe three out of the Text, to Adapt the Generations from David to the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, to the Number of fourteen, which was delightful unto them, for there is extant a Syriack Copy as Ancient as that Tranſlation from the Hebrew, which ſets down theſe three Kings in the Genealogy, and at the end of them computes four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, and not ſeventeen Generations, and this computation of fourteen Generations, the Hebrews introduced in the place of ſeventeen for allyance to fourteen, which was a Number grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto them; for that on the fourteenth day they departed from the Bondage of Aegypt. Others ſay, that Mathew omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe Names, becauſe they were abominable in the Eyes of the Jews, for Achaſia aſſociated himſelf to the Houſe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab, having ſent Ships to fetch Gold, and aſcended unto the High Places of Ramath Gilead with Ahab, and reproved the Prophet, and was afterwards ſlain by Jehu, and Joaſh by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Sons of Jehojedah the Prieſt. Amotſia alſo was ſlain in Rebellion, having excited the King of Iſrael to War with him, and by occaſion of him, and by his hands, was the Wall broken, and the Sanctuary violated, wherefore Mathew omitted them, for the ſtock will take up that which is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſiah begat Jocaniah, and his Brethren in the Babyloniſh Tranſmigration;</hi> in the Book of the Kings, and in the book of Bar Jamin it is not Written, that Joſiah begat Jocaniah, but that Joſiah had five Sons, Jehu, Achaz and Eliakim, who was Joiakim, and Shalon, and John, and Tſedekiah, who was Mathania. Others ſay, That Joſiah begat Jehoas, who was John, and Jojakim, who was Eliakim, and Tſedekia who was Mathania, and Shalon who was Jokania; others call Shalom Jokania; the book of Bar Jamin, that is to ſay, computing the Sons of Joſiah, and Joiakim, who is Eliakim, begat Jokaniah who is Joiakim, who was led Captive to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and how is it that Mathew doth not write, That Joſiah begat Joiakim, and Joiakim Jokaniah; and Georgius ſaith, That he wrote ſo, but ſaith, that the Tranſcriber miſtook,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37030:12"/>and wrote Jocaniah, inſtead of Joiakim. Others ſay, That Mathew omitted Joiakim, becauſe he was deſpiſed, and ſlew Euria the Prophet, the Son of Shamaiah, and had Defeated, as he thought, the Prophets. Jokania his Son departed, leaſt the Sanctuary ſhould be reproached, and was perfect, and therefore he ſets down his Name. Others ſay, That Manaſſeh was worſe than he, how then doth Mathew ſet down his Name? But we Anſwer, that every one of them was called by two Names, as Joiakim, and Eliakim, and Joiakim and Jokania the Son of Joiakim; wherefore Jokania was the Grandſon of Joſiah; and he calls him his Son according to the Uſage of Scripture, which calls Lot Abrahams Brothers Son, his own Brother; for, Abraham ſaid, <hi>We are Brethren,</hi> and Laban the Sons of his Daughters.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Nathania, and Jehoaaz, who were the Uncles of Jokania, he calls them his Brothers.</p>
            <p>Again, Joſiah begat Jehoaaz who was called Shalom, and Eliakim, who was Jojakim, and Mathania who is called Tſedekia; and from the time that <hi>Pharaoh the Lame</hi> ſlew Joſiah, he made Johoaaz his Son to Reign, whom when Pharaoh had bound and looſed, he placed as King in his ſtead Eliakim his Brother, the Son of Joſiah, and Pharaoh called him Joiakim; and after the death of Jojakim, he made Jojakim the Son of Jocania to Reign, and afterwards he was called by the Name of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jojakim, and him Nebuchadnezzar led away captive, and placed in his ſtead Mathaniah his Uncle, who was called Tſedekiah by Nebuchadnezzar; all theſe the Evangeliſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, in ſaying, <hi>Jeconia and his Brethren;</hi> for the Kingdom was derived by all of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Captivity of Babylon.</hi> He mentioneth the Captivity of Babylon, to ſhew that the Jews were not amended from their iniquity, no not after they were led into Captivity. And again, for that the Captivity remained for Generations, he ſaid, <hi>From the Captivity until Chriſt, Fourteen Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, becauſe there was a neceſſity of the coming of Chriſt, that he might redeem us from the Captivity of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and of Death, he doth not mention the going down into
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37030:13"/>Egypt, as he doth the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> for that deſcent was a long time before, and this was but newly paſt; and that was not for their Sins, but it was for their Sins that they were led Captive into <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, they did not fear the Aegyptians, but they were in a continual dread of the Babylonians; but foraſmuch as Joſiah did not ſee the Captivity of Babylon; wherefore did Mathew ſay, That Joſiah did beget Jokaniah, and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Captivity of Babylon? We anſwer, That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Captivity is computed from the time of Joſiah, becauſe then Jeremia propheſied concerning it: Even as God ſaid unto Abraham, <hi>Thy ſeed ſhall ſerve in a Bondage Nine Years,</hi> where the years are reckoned from the day wherein thoſe Words were ſpoken, until the going out of Egypt. So in the time of Joſiah Jeremiah propheſied concerning the Captivity, and from that time made his Computation, and for that reaſon accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates the Captivity to Joſiah; on the thirteenth year of Joſiah Jeremiah propheſied concerning the Captivity, and from that time to the thirtieth and one year of Joſiah his Reign.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jocaniah begat Shelathiel, and Shelathiel begat Zorobabel.</hi> Jeremy ſaid concerning Jocania, That his Seat was deſpiſed, as being without Sons, and that none of his Seed ſhould ſit on the Throne of David; yet Mathew here ſaid, That Chriſt did deſcend from him by Genealogy, according to that, <hi>The Lord will give unto him the Throne of David his Father;</hi> and Ld. Severus ſaith, That this of Joconiah, the Prophet ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo, for that the Earthly Kingdom was held in Judah but the Kingdom of Chriſt, and his Throne, was not the Earthly one, but that which is heavenly, in reſpect whereof, he ſaid, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> yet is he King over the ends of the Earth.</p>
            <p>Others ſay, That Joconia who was before and in the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, was not the ſame of whom Mathew ſaid, that he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Captivity; but that other who was before the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, of whom mention is made in the Book of the Kings, is he who was after the Captivity, and in the Book of Jeremiah is mentioned, whom he curſed, and called Joiakim.</p>
            <p>Others ſay, That the Joconia of whom Jeremy ſpeaks, was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37030:13"/>not the ſame with that of Mathew, and he of whom Jeremy ſpeaks, was Tſedekiah the Son of Joſiah, whoſe Children were ſlain before his face in the Captivity, and he dy'd in Babylon, grinding in a Mill; but he of whom Mathew ſpeaks was Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koniah the Son of Jojakim, and his Mother was called Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhan, and ſhe was the Siſter of Jeremy the Prophet; and this Jokoniah begat Shelathiel.</p>
            <p>It is now neceſſary to enquire whether Shelathiel and Zoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel, mentioned by Mathew, be the ſame with thoſe of Saint Luke, or others; and if they be the ſame, wherefore doth Mathew call Shelathiel the Son of Jokonia, whom Luke calls the Son of Neri? We anſwer, That St. Severus wrote that often-times Mathew and Luke produced the very ſame Perſons; for Families are uſed after the ſimilitude of Rivers, which run in divided Channels to run together again, and being divided from one another, to be intermixed by intermediate Perſons after they have been long ſeparated; for behold, both the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts make mention of Shelathiel, for Mathew names him the Son of Jokonia according to the courſe of Natural Generation, and Luke calls him the Son of Neri, in reſpect of Legal Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

            <p>Malchim, the Father of Neri, who was derived from Nathan, took to wife one who was called Nahaſhtha, the Daughter of Eliathan from Jeruſalem, and of her begat Neri; and when
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37030:14"/>Malchim died, Jojakim the King took Nahaſhtha for her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and begat Jokonia, and this Neri and Jokonia were Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren by the Mother; and Neri took a wife and died without Children, and Joconia his Brother took her, and of her begat Shelathiel, according as was commanded by the Law, that if a Man ſhould die without Children, his Brother ſhould take his wife, and raiſe Seed to his deceaſed Brother; and Shela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiel was the Son of Jokonia by Natural Propagation, and the Son of Neri by Legal Inſtitution: And Mathew ſaid, that Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konia was the natural Son of Jojakim, and Luke ſaith that She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathiel was the legal Son of Neri; wherefore both of them are in the right.</p>
            <p>Georgius ſaith, that they were not the ſame; but that Neri, who was derived from Nathan, being willing to reſemble his Son by the Son of Jokonia the King, called him Shalathiel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his name, even as Shalathiel in emulation, willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent his Son by the Son of Shelathiel, called him Zorobabel, And this is certain from hence, that there are many Names im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Mathew from David and under, which are ſynonimous with thoſe of Luke, ſuch as are Joram, Eliezer and Eliakim, for there was often-times a Synonimity in the Genealogy, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Chance, or Deſign, as ſay the Philoſophers.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is doubtful how Malkim being from Nathan, took at firſt Nahaſhta, and after that he begat Neri from her, and died, Jojakim the King ſhould take the Widow, he being Eighteen years of Age, and of her begat Jokonia; or after that he was ſlain, that ſhe became wife to Malkim, and brought forth Neri: Both theſe Opinions are doubtful; this, that we ſhould believe that Jojakim in his youth ſhould take to wife a widdow woman, or that ſhe who had been a Queen ſhould marry one of a mean condition, being of another Tribe.</p>
            <p>Beſides it is written in the book of the Kings, that Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezer led Joiakim and his mother, and his wife into captivity; and if Nahaſhta the mother of Joiakim deſcended with her Son into captivity, it is unlikely that ſhe was marryed after the death of Jojakim her husband, neither would Joſiah have taken the widdow of Malkim for a wife to his Son Jojakim, therefore Neri the Son of Shelathiel, the Son of Jokonia, of whom Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37030:14"/>wrote, is not Shelathiel the Son of Neri, whom Luke ſets down, neither is it written either in the book of the Kings, or in the book of Bar Jamin, that Jokonia had a Son called Neri who dying childleſs, Jokonia took his wife, and of her begat Shela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiel. In the book of Bar jamin it is written thus concerning the Sons of Joſia, Jehoaaz, John, Jojakim, Tſedikia, Shalom; and that Jokonia was the Son of Jojakim; therefore they are not the ſame who are mentioned by Mathew and Luke, neither do they agree in Name.</p>

               <hi>Zurubabel begat Abiud.</hi> Zurubabel is expounded the Seed of Babel, becauſe he was there begotten, and born, Mathew ſaid, <hi>That Zurubabel begat Abiud,</hi> and Luke ſaith, <hi>That Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubabel begat Reſa;</hi> my Lord Severus ſaith, That Zurubabel had two Sons, Abiud, and Reſa, and that Mathew reckons the one, and Luke the other, and as from David the Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligies are divided between Nathan, and Solomon; and they deſcend to Joſeph, Mathew taking up the Genealogie of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and Luke that of Nathan; ſo alſo from Shelathiel the Genealogies are divided between Abiud, and Reſa, and they likewiſe come down to Joſeph.</p>
            <p>Georgius de gentibus ſaith, That the Zurubabel who begat Abiud, and the other who begat Reſa, of whom Luke ſpeaks, were different perſons; others ſay, That Abiud the Son of Zurubabel was called by two Names, Abiud ſaying I and Reſa, and therefore every of the Evangeliſts call him by a particular Name, even as the Sons of Joſiah were every of them called by two Names.</p>

               <hi>ex qua,</hi> and not <hi>ex quo,</hi> he makes it manifeſt that he was born of Mary, and not of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph.</p>
            <p>Moreover, by reaſon he added <hi>the Husband of Mary,</hi> he ſheweth, that he recited the Genealogie with regard to Mary, and that ſhe was of the Houſe of David, and of Abraham, and therefore he brings in her Name. Mathew calleth Joſeph the Son of Jacob, and Luke calleth him the Son of Heli, for that there was a certain Man whoſe Name was Mathan, of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neage of Solomon, and he took a Wife whoſe Name was Eſther, and of her he begat Jacob; and Mathan dyed, and Eſther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Wiſe of Matatha, of the Progeny of Nathan; and of her he begat Heli, and Eſther had two Sons, one by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and one by Mattatha, and Heli took a Wife, and died Childleſs, and Jacob his Brother took his Wife in conformity to the Law, that he might raiſe Seed to him who was Dead, that his Name might not be forgotten, and Jacob begat Joſeph, and Joſeph was the Son of Jacob according to natural propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and to Heli according to the diſpoſition of Law, and Mathew calleth him in reſpect of Nature, and Luke with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Law, for, naturally the traduction of Seed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Law was his, who begat (Children) in the name of his deceaſed Brother, who died Childleſs.</p>
            <p>Wherefore doth Mathew proceed to Solomon, but Luke ſets down Nathan, and ſo they run down to Joſeph?</p>
            <p>Some ſay, that Mary was derived from Solomon, and Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph from Nathan, and Mathew ſets forth the Genealogy of Mary, but Luke that of Joſeph, and if it be ſo, wherefore doth Mathew declare this concerning Jacob, that he begat Joſeph, whereas naturally he did not beget him? And if they ſhall ſay that Luke ſpeaks of the Genealogy of Mary, and Mathew of that of Joſeph, wherefore did Luke impoſe this upon the ſtock from whence Chriſt was born, that he was <hi>ſuppoſed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Philoxenus ſaid, That Mathew wrote concerning the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37030:15"/>Genealogy, and therefore ſaid, ſuch an one begat ſuch an one, but Luke treated of Legal Genealogies, and therefore wrote this, that he was <hi>ſuppoſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hereunto Affricanus gives Teſtimony, who ſaid, that the Names of the Genealogies were reckoned among the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, either naturally, from the account of Seed, or accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the direction of Law, as, he who is born by Adoption to one who dies without Children, or of one who begets in the Name of his Brother dying Childleſs, for, as yet they had no hope of the Reſurrection; and the Evangeliſts computed both the Natural and Legal Genealogy, for the Genealogies of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon and Nathan were intermixed: Wherefore each of them from Nathan as well as from Solomon, was the Father of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph; Eli who was of Nathan, and Jacob who was of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and he was by Nature the Son of Jacob, but by Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Law the Son of Heli, that is to ſay Eli. And whereas Mathew ſhewed, according to the Natural Account of Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, that Joſeph was derived from David, and ſome Men ſeemed to oppoſe him, and ſaid that Joſeph was the Son of Heli, and not of Jacob, prevaricating in reſpect of the Legal Genealogy: Wherefore Luke, minded to confute their folly, ſhewed, that though Joſeph ſhould be referred to Heli by Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Inſtitution, yet even ſo the Lineage of Chriſt would be found to proceed from David. For, he did not place the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogy on Mary, nor did he ſay, ſuch an one begat Mary, of whom Chriſt was born; for it was not the Cuſtom of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews to derive Genealogies by Women, wherefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes not Mary but Joſeph, that he might not ſeem to confound Order.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we ſay, That in the Commemoration of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, the Virgin alſo is notified with him to have deſcended from David; for every Tribe was knit with its own Tribe; although ſome rare Examples there are of departing from Tribe to Tribe: But Joſeph and Mary were near related to one another reſpectively, as the Grand-children of two Brothers; One Eliezer begat two Sons, Mathan and Jotham, and Mathan begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Joſeph; and Jotham begat
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37030:16"/>Tſadock, and Tſadok begat Mary; and her Mothers Name was Dinah, and ſhe was the Siſter of Elizabeth; and this was ſhe of whom it was ſaid, <hi>Behold, Elizabeth thy Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The matter was ordered by hint of Divine Providence, that the Kingdom and Prieſthood of David and of Levi, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive accompliſhment in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Moreover, for this reaſon he reckons Joſeph, and not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for that if the Jews had known that Mary had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Joſeph, they had ſtoned her; her Virginity was conceal'd from all Mankind, except Joſeph, who learn'd it from the Angel, and Elizabeth who learn'd it from the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>John ſaith, Chriſt was not willing that they ſhould know the manner of his Nativity, viz. that he was born of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, but reſerved the knowledge thereof to its proper time, that the Virgin might be free from puniſhment; for if the Jews had learned thus much at firſt, they had not believed that a Virgin could bring forth, and they had ſtoned her: For if they called him who drove out Devils, <hi>The Prince of Devils,</hi> how would they believe that <hi>a Virgin ſhould bring forth (a Son?)</hi> It may be enquired, Where were the Fathers of Mary, for her Father was called by many Names, Joiachim, Jojachim, Jonchir, Tſadok, Jezedik, and her Mother alſo was called Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na and Hana?</p>
            <p>Jacobus Auraeus ſaith, That Hiſtories do recount that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was the Daughter of Jojachim of the Tribe of Judah, who was the Son of Aſther, in the Original Panthir, and Aſther was the Brother of Malchi the Son of Neni in the Original, he who was of Neri, and deſcended by the Genealogy from Nathan, and was on the Mothers ſide from the Tribe of Levi, and dwelt in Galilee, in a place of the City of Tiberia; he calls Joſeph the Husband of Mary, when he was her Spouſe, according to the Cuſtom of the Scripture; for it is ſaid in <hi>Deuteronomy, If there ſhall be a Wife betrothed unto a Man, and a Man ſhall find her and lie with her, take them both forth and let them be ſtoned; the young Woman, becauſe ſhe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37030:16"/>did not reveal it; and the Man, for that he lay with his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is known from hence, that he who is betrothed is called Husband; and ſhe who is eſpouſed, is called Wife; whence it is known that Chriſt and the Virgin were of the Seed of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</p>
            <p>We ſay it is manifeſt that Chriſt is of the Seed of David ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, from this, That he was born of Mary, who was of the Houſe of David, and of his Seed; and it is certain that the Virgin deſcended from David, becauſe every one took a Wife of his own Tribe, that Inheritance might not be in Commixture, nor Confuſion be in the Lands, nor War amongſt them; and Joſeph obſerved this Commandment, and took Mary a Daughter of David; for had ſhe not been from David, ſhe had not gone up to Bethlehem with Joſeph the Son of David.</p>
            <p>But how did Chriſt fit on the Throne <hi>of David?</hi> We ſay, That there ſeems to be a threefold kind of Davids Throne; the one was corporal which was made of Wood and Ivory. and was Adorned with pretious Stones. Secondly, They were accuſtomed to call the Throne of the Kingdom the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie and Authority over the whole Nation. The third is according to what God promiſed to David, <hi>I will build thy Throne for ever and ever;</hi> and, <hi>His Throne ſhall be as the Sun before me;</hi> but theſe things which were promiſed to David but not fulfilled, were accompliſh'd in our Saviour, according to the Word of Gabriel, who called the Houſe of Jacob, <hi>The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles who believe in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourteen Generations:</hi> For he doth not ſay the forty two Generations altogether, nor doth he divide them into ſix parts, for the Number <hi>Seven</hi> was dear unto them; but he divided the Total into three parts, hinting thereby, that as it was not grievous unto them, that they were changed from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Judges, to the Government of Kings; and from the Government of Kings, to the Government of High-Prieſts; ſo it ſhould not ſeem ſtrange in your Eyes, that ye are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from theſe to the Government of Chriſt, tho Chriſt alſo
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37030:17"/>was a Judge, a King, and an High-Prieſt; for as his ancient Types Miniſtred unto him, ſo he applyed them altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf.</p>
            <p>The Jews Accuſed the Apoſtles as introducing new Laws to the Creature, and Mathew willing to ſhew that they were far from blame, he ſignified that the Government of God always varied in the Adminiſtration of Affairs, accordingly as was expedient, and agreeably to the Mutation of things, divided the Number of Generations; from Abraham unto Saul they were ſubject to Judges; Mathew accounts <hi>Saul</hi> as a Judge, for that he Governing filled up the time and was rejected. They were under Kings ceaſed in the Captivity, they were Governed by the Chief Prieſts; wherefore, according to the change of Conſtitutions he divided things, and he hints, that it is no wonder, if he who at firſt ſet up Judges, and afterwards Kings, and then Rulers, ſhould ſet up the Government of his Son, for neither did the change of State-Affairs amend the Jews; but whileſt they were Governed by Judges, Kings and Rulers, they ſtill continued in the ſame Sins.</p>
            <p>Philoxenus ſaid, That therefore he divided the Generations into three parts, becauſe the Father revealed the Promiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Son in three Places; to Abraham; ſaying, <hi>in thy Seed ſhall the Nations be Bleſſed.</hi> To David, <hi>I will Eſtabliſh thy Seed for ever;</hi> Moreover by another Prophet, that <hi>David my Servant ſhall feed them,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others ſay, That this Promiſe was made to Adam at his Creation, and that for this Reaſon, he Aſcended unto Adam, he divided them into doubled Sevens, that is to ſay fourteens, that by Weeks he might Illuſtrate the Words of Daniel, and (to ſhew) that he was the expected Meſſiah, and that the Prophets preached concerning him.</p>

            <p>Others ſay, That the laſt part was made Thirteen, by leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out One between Shelathiel and Zorubabel, that is to ſay, Nadabia, that the Number of Fourteen may be made up of Mary, for that inſtead of her Fore-fathers, ſhe entred into the place of a Generation, or he brought Chriſt into the place of a Generation, as we have ſaid.</p>
            <p>Euſebius ſaith, That he doth not reckon Fourteen Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the Number of Men, but ſome certain quantity of years, which was divided into Fourteen parts: The firſt part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of eight hundred years, and the Generations thereof were Fourteen; but the middlemoſt conſiſted of four hundred years, and its Generations were Twelve; the firſt and the laſt were equal as to the Number of Perſons, but he computes the the middlemoſt with the Two, by reaſon of the paucity of Years and Perſons.</p>

               <p>Moreover, Thoſe of Luke from Abraham to Joſeph, were fifty five Fathers; and from David to Joſeph were forty two, and thoſe of Mathew from Abraham to Joſeph were forty and two, taking into Computation the Captivity and Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Whence did Mathew and Luke learn the Genealogie? We ſay from the Holy Ghoſt, as the Prophets taught hidden things, and from the book of Bar Jamin, and from the books of Eſra. Moreover, it was the Cuſtom of the Jews to repeat their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Genealogies by word of Mouth, or Tradition. <hi>I ſuch a one the Son of ſuch a one,</hi> from one to another, unto Adam. Wherefore Paul commanded Timothy <hi>to abſtain from Fables and Genealogies.</hi> Mathew becauſe he wrote to the Hebrews, began from Abraham and David, becauſe to them the Promiſe was made, and that was ſufficient to Anſwer his purpoſe; but Luke Aſcended to Adam, becauſe he wrote to the Gentiles, to ſhew that Chriſt alſo ſprung from Adam, and to abate the Pride of the Jews who gloried in Abraham. Again he Aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Adam, in myſtery of Baptiſm, to ſhew that he who is Baptiz'd and Regenerated, is to Aſcend to God whoſe Sons we are made. And moreover, to take away that doubt; <hi>How can a Virgin bring forth a Child,</hi> he ſhew'd, that as the <hi>Spirit</hi> was able in the beginning to form Man without Copulation; ſo was he able at laſt, and formed the body of the Word from the Virgin without Copulation, for it was the one and the ſame operation of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghoſt; and for that the Father framed Adam, it is certain that the Son and the Spirit framed him.</p>
               <p>Wherefore doth Mathew deſcend in the Genealogy, and Luke Aſcend?</p>
               <p>We ſay, that this is the Cuſtom of the Scripture, it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of Ruth, <hi>Pharez</hi> begat <hi>Hezron,</hi> and <hi>Hezron Aram,</hi> and <hi>Aram Aminadab,</hi> and <hi>Aminadab,</hi> and ſo forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he deſcended to David. It Aſcends where it ſaith <hi>Helkana</hi> the Son of <hi>Jochom,</hi> the Son of Elihu, the Son of Aho, the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37030:19"/>Son of Reſoph. Again Mathew deſcends to ſhew, that the Word of God deſcended, and came for our Redemption accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Promiſe firſt made. But Luke Aſcended, to ſhew that they who are Baptiſed mount up to Heaven; and this is manifeſt from hence, that he ſpoke of the Genealogy, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Moreover. Mathew recounts the Natural Generation, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, That the Natural Generation brought us downward; but Luke the Legal Generation, to ſhew that the Legal Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is to us an adumbration of Adoption, and of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and that we are to Aſcend by the Laver of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to be made the Sons of God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore doth Luke compute ſo many Names from David to Chriſt being forty three, and thoſe of Mathew are but twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight, beſides thoſe omitted by the Writers, being <hi>revera</hi> thirty two?</p>
               <p>We ſay, That there was not an equal courſe of Generations in all Families; for it was one progeny that draweth from Nathan to David, according to Luke; and that is another which is by Solomon as Mathew Wrote; for we have ſeen many being of equal years who took Wives, ſome of whom have Children and Grand Children; ſo that in the one may appear three deſcents, and in the other one; wherefore it is no wonder, if one Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogy be more or leſs fruitful than another in deſcents. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Mathew reckons the Natural Fathers from David to Chriſt; but Luke computed Natural and Legal, and therefore Luke hath more than Mathew.</p>
               <p>Wherefore doth Mathew compute the Natural Genealogy, and Luke the Legal? Becauſe Luke had formerly learnt, That the Jews blamed Mathew concerning the Genealogy, for that he had mentioned culpable perſons, as Jochania.</p>
               <p>Moreover, They ſaid that Joſeph, although he was Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Son of Jacob, yet it being not fit, that his Name ſhould have been Written with his Name;<note place="margin">Luke.</note> but that <hi>Eli</hi> was he on whoſe Name the Seed was Eſtabliſh'd; <hi>He</hi> being willing to ſolve this Querie wrote the Legal Progenies, and Aſcends to Genealogy of Perſons, who were differing from Nathan; and comes again to call the Progeny, and ſheweth, that although
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37030:19"/>Joſeph ſhould be referred to <hi>Eli,</hi> yet <hi>ſo</hi> Chriſt appears to be of the Lineage of David.</p>
               <p>An Objection of <hi>Julian the Wicked:</hi> If Luke wrote the Legal Genealogies, wherefore ſpeaks he of Obed the Son of Boaz as according to Nature, and not of the Son of Malion, according to the Law as it is written in Ruth?</p>
               <p>And we anſwer, That the Mad-man did not underſtand the matter; for the Controverſie concerning Joſeph was Whether he was from David or no; and there was no Controverſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this from David to Abraham, for all the Jews were from Abraham; therefore Luke from Chriſt to David com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes the Legal Fathers, and from David to Abraham the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and from Abraham to Adam the Legal Pedigree.</p>
               <p>Wherefore doth Mathew mention the culpable Men and Women, and Luke the vertuous?</p>
               <p>We anſwer, That it was Mathews deſign to ſhew that God came to call Sinners to Repentance, and did not diſdain that Mankind whom he created, ſhould be united to him, and that he ſhould Juſtifie the ſame; and for this Reaſon he mentioned the Culpable: But Luke having a deſign to teach that it was unfit that ſuch as we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Aphricanus and Euſebius place Malchi in the third place from the end, as alſo <hi>Mathan,</hi> who is written before Joſeph; <hi>Joſeph the Son of Eli the Son of Malchi:</hi> But in the Syriack Copy of Luke, remaining with us, he is ſet in the fifth place, <hi>Joſeph the Son of Heli, the Son of Matthath, the Son of Levi, the Son of Malchi.</hi> Moreover Aphricanus placeth Fifty Perſons in Luke from Abraham to Joſeph, and in the Syriack Copy of Luke there were Fifty ſix, and it is neceſſary to enquire after the Truth.</p>
               <p>Gregorius Theologus ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There were Seventy Seven Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations from Adam to Chriſt according to the diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Genealogies of Luke; the Gloſſarie and Jacobus Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis in the Epiſtle to Maron ſaith, That from Abraham to Chriſt were forty two Generation as Mathew wrote, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37030:20"/>to Luke Fifty Seven. If therefore according to the Sayings of theſe Doctors, and according to our Copy of the Goſpel, there were 77. Generations from Adam to Chriſt, there remain 57 from Abraham to Chriſt, as ſaith Dominus Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus; ſo that taking one from 57, <hi>to wit Chriſt,</hi> there are left 56 from Abraham to Joſeph; and not fifty only, as ſaid Aphri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus, and our Syriack Copies are true; and Aphricanus is not <hi>ſo</hi> in ſetting down only 50 perſons. And this alſo we are finally to take notice of, that in the Syriack Copy, there are written 55 perſons from Joſeph to Abraham, and not 56, as ſaid Theologus, and Jacobus Batanenſis; and we are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the Scribe omitted one Name, and ſo it was left out of many Copies, computing the Names from Chriſt to Nathan the Son of David. In the Greek and Syriack Goſpel, there are found but 42; ſo, that adding thereunto 14 Generations from David to Abraham, they make up only 56, and not 57, as ſaid Jacobus; which being all put together, amount to 76, and not to 77, as ſaid Theologus, there being one Name for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten about the Middle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Nativity of Jeſus Chriſt was thus:</hi> For our Lord is called in Scripture by 52 Names; whereof ſome agree to the time before his being made Man, as the Word, the Son, Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and the like; and ſome to the time of being made Man, as Jeſus Chriſt; and ſome denote his Union, as Emanuel, ſo called from the Divinity and the Humanity, which Word Emanuel is Expounded, <hi>God with us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here it behoves us to inquire, what the Name Jeſuah ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies? We ſay, That Jeſuah is an Hebrew Name, and with us imports a Redeemer; but the Grecians call him <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and ſay, that it is Expounded <hi>Healing;</hi> therefore he is a Redeemer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he Redeemed his people from their Sins; and he is <hi>Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> becauſe he <hi>Healed</hi> and Cured thoſe who lay under the Calamity of Sickneſs and Diſeaſes; and Moſes impoſed firſt the Name on Joſhuah the Son of Nun; and he was a Type of Chriſt, and was at firſt called Hoſhea; and as this Name was impoſed from verity of Fact, ſo the Name <hi>Emanuel</hi> ſignifieth this, that by Birth from a Woman, <hi>The Word of God was with us.</hi> The Word Chriſt teacheth us, That as Man he is ſaid to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37030:20"/>have been Anointed after the manner of Men, as the Name Jeſus ſignifieth, that he Revived and Redeemed us; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Names of Jeſus, Chriſt, and Emanuel, are the ſame in force of Underſtanding; Moreover, The Name Chriſt ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth an Unction in Chriſt, a certain kind of Election.</p>
               <p>The Ancients had three ſorts of Anointing, firſt Paraboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally with Oyl, as Kings and Prieſts; Or <hi>by Grace,</hi> That is to ſay, by the Spirit in an hidden manner, as Prophets and Prieſts; or for Honor and Diſtinction by direction of Actings as the houſe of Abraham, Cyrus and Hazael; and the name Anointing is uſed in ſeven manner of ways. Firſt, For quantity, as what is meaſured by Cubits, or Palms, and as the Angel meaſured Jeruſalem a thouſand Cubits, and <hi>as with a Span meaſureth he Man.</hi> Secondly, For Grace as the Prophets, who were Anointed privately with the Spirit: Thirdly, for Oyl, as the Kings and Prieſts were Anointed with Holy Oyl, and Men likewiſe with ordinary Oyl. Fourthly, in the way of Honour, as it was ſaid of the Houſe of Abraham and Iſaack, <hi>Touch not my Anointed.</hi> Fifthly, by way of Diſtinction, as they who are ſet apart to do ſomewhat by Direction, as Cyrus and Hazael, who being ſeperated for a deſign, were called <hi>Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> Sixthly, for Faith, as, <hi>That which is of Faith, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is as the Body of Chriſt.</hi> Seventhly, for the Holy Ghoſt, even as the Word Anointed his Body, that is with his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and with his Spirit; for the Chriſt whom we Worſhip; we do not call ſo, as the Man born only of Mary, and afterwards Anointed by the Spirit, and Sanctified, as the Hereticks ſay; but we call Chriſt the Word of God, who was begotten of the Father from Eternity, and we call him Chriſt, becauſe he vouchſafed to be Anointed with the Spirit, and to be Sanctified in the Fleſh, and as his Nature was high and above the Birth of a Woman of Paſſion and Death; and yet vouchſafed to be born, and to ſuffer, and to dye in the Fleſh for us; ſo did he take upon him to be Anointed with the Spirit, being the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of it, and Holy in in his own Nature, he was pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Grace of the Spirit, as not needing it, and therefore receiv'd it, that he might beſtow it upon us. And in all things he was the beginning to us as the Second Adam, according to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37030:21"/>the ſaying of Paul, <hi>That by his means he might give us the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.</hi> Moreover, we call him Chriſt, becauſe the Spirit deſcended into the Womb of the Virgin, as the Angel ſaid; and this Spirit framed the body of the Word of God, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed and Sanctified it, and ſo the Word was United to this Body; and this the Spirit did, not that it was unable to frame and Sanctifie the body out of the Womb, but that it might be known, that he that was born was God coequal in Nature with the Spirit, who formed and Sanctified the body, and not meer Man. Again the Spirit formed the body of the Word, and Sanctified and Anointed it, that the diſtinctions of perſons in the Trinity might be made known. It was the Fathers plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Son ſhould be incorporated, and it was the Holy Ghoſt who made him a Body, in that he formed his body of the Virgin: The ſame Order was obſerved in the Creation. The Father commanded things to be made, and the Son made them, and the Spirit finiſh'd and accompliſh'd them. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, the Father ſaid <hi>Anoint,</hi> and the Son was Anointed; and the Spirit ſupplied the place of Oyl; wherefore we call the Word of God <hi>Chriſt</hi> or <hi>Anointed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, we call the Word of God, Chriſt, for two Reaſons, and the firſt is, for that he vouchſafed to be Anointed in the Fleſh by the Holy Spirit, tho' equal in Nature with the Giver of the ſame; Secondly, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt Anointed and Sanctified his body, being United to the Word: Moreover, this Name Chriſt teacheth the whole Doctrine of the Trinity, it was the Father who Anointed, the Son who was Anointed, and the Holy Ghoſt was the Oyl or Unction; he who ſaid, That Chriſt was made Man Naturally, and that he was Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Spirit for Sanctification, let him tell us, where he was Anointed? if before his Conception? he had then no body in the Womb of the Virgin; and behold, it is not written that he was Anointed at his Baptiſm; but behold, he was called Chriſt at his Birth: Some Hereticks there are, who ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt ſignifies one made Man, againſt whom we ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt ſignifies the <hi>Word of God,</hi> not as he is God alone, but as he is <hi>made Man.</hi> Again, The Name of Jeſus Chriſt doth not denote Man from Mary, nor God and Man together, but the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37030:21"/>
                  <hi>Word of God,</hi> and it is moſt certain from hence; for Jeſus ſaith thus to the Jews, <hi>Him whom the Father ſanctified and ſent into the World, do ye ſay, Thou art a Blaſphemer?</hi> Who therefore was he who was ſent from the Father, Man? Or God and Man together? Or the Word? as ſaith Paul, that <hi>God ſent his Son, and he was made of a Woman.</hi> Therefore he who was ſent to the World is the Word which was from the Father, and he is called Jeſus, and is the ſame who is ſaid to be Sanctified, and not meer Man, neither God and Man together, but the Father Sanctified the Word by the Holy Ghoſt who Anointed him; not as he is God, for ſo he is equal to the Father, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Giver of Holineſs; but as he was made Man for us. Moreover, Chriſt ſaid, before <hi>Abraham was, I am;</hi> who therefore was before Abraham, the Man who was of Mary? or God and Man together? For the Man who was from Mary was ſo far from being before Abraham, that he was not before Mary, but after Mary, being born of her; 'tis certain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Word of God who was called by this Name of Jeſus Chriſt, was before Abraham.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, Jeſus ſaid to the Jews, <hi>What ſay ye concerning Chriſt whoſe Son is he? They ſaid unto him the Son of David, and he ſaid unto them, How did David call him in the Spirit Lord? for he ſaid, The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit on my right Hand; if David called him Lord, how was he his Son?</hi> he therefore who is the Lord of David, is the Man from Mary, who as yet was not in the time of David, nor Mary of whom he was born. Either he calls Man and God together Chriſt; for he calls one in the ſingular Number, <hi>my Lord,</hi> and not many Lords; it is therefore certain that he calls the Word of God coequal with the Father in Nature, Lord, according to this, <hi>The Lord ſent down Fire from before the Lord on Sodom;</hi> and according to this alſo, <hi>There is born unto them to day a Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who is the Lord Chriſt,</hi> wherefore he calls him Chriſt; again, it is written, <hi>That thy Throne is for ever and ever,</hi> after he had called him God, and ſaid, <hi>Thy Scepter is for ever and ever,</hi> that is to ſay, there is no end or term to his Kingdom; he ſaid, <hi>God hath Anointed thee,</hi> that is, the Father hath A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed the Word of God by the Holy Spirit. but not as God,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37030:22"/>but as he was made Man; and accordingly as the Word ſaid, <hi>He whom the Father Sanctified and Sent.</hi> Moreover, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaid, <hi>He hath Anointed him above his Fellows,</hi> that is, he hath Anointed him above us, and above the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and others who are Anointed, for all Men who are Anointed of the Spirit, receive what they ſtand in need of; but the Word being Sanctified and Anointed with the Spirit, received it, tho not in want thereof, but full, and a beſtower thereof on others, as ſaid <hi>John, That of his fulneſs we have all receiv'd;</hi> and being equal in Nature, and a Giver of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he vouchſafed to be Anointed therewith; that by means of him he might give us his own; wherefore the Word of God is called Chriſt, not for that he was Man, nor Man of Mery, nor Man and God together; and this John confirms, ſaying, <hi>There are different Spirits, ſome are of God, and ſome of this World; every Spirit that ſaith Jeſus Chriſt is not come in the fleſh, this is not of God, but of the World, this being certain; that he who came in the fleſh is the Word of God;</hi> and John calls him Chriſt, and he is not Man, nor Man and God together. Moreover, Paul ſaith, <hi>We have one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and one Lord Jeſus, by whom are all things, and this further, that in Chriſt all things were created.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Paul ſaith unto the Philippians, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt being the likeneſs of the Father, thought this no Robbery to be compared with God;</hi> what therefore is this compariſon, or equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Who therefore is to be compared with God the Father? the Man (born) of Mary? or God and Man? or the Word? For Man is not only not equal to God, but is alſo a Creature and a Servant; but the Word of God is to be compared with God the Father, becauſe he is of the ſame Nature and Coequal in Eſſence, and did not Uſurp this, but had it Naturally: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, who was it that emptied himſelf? Man of Mary? or Man and God together? or the the Word of God? Man was already empty, neceſſitous and indigent, and the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak of both God and Man, nor are there two that ſtand in compariſon with God, and did empty themſelves; but the Word emptied himſelf, becauſe he was made Man; and he it was who emptied himſelf in the Fleſh, without being changed.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:37030:22"/>
               <p>Furthermore it is written, that he aſſumed the likeneſs of a Servant, he aſſum'd, and was not aſſumed; for <hi>Man</hi> was aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and did not aſſume, it being impoſſible that both of them ſhould aſſume, but the one aſſumed, and the other was aſſum'd: Again, <hi>That he emptied himſelf,</hi> what is it? 'tis this, that being God, he was voluntarily made Man without being changed. Secondly, That being equal in Nature with the Spirit and Giver thereof, and had Sanctity naturally, he did vouchſafe to be Anointed by the Holy Ghoſt, inaſmuch as he was Incarnated. Thirdly, That his Nature being High and above Paſſions, he took ſufferings upon him, and ſuffer'd death in the Fleſh, not as God, but as Man; yet he ſuffer'd natural Paſſions, but not culpable, Hunger, Thirſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he bore Evil and contemptible Names of Reproach, being God, and Lord, and King. And the three hundred and eighteen Fathers call the <hi>Word</hi> Jeſus Chrſt, and not the Man from Mary, nor Man and God together, for they ſaid, <hi>And in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt the only Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again we ſay to thoſe (who maintain this Errour, that if the <hi>Word Chriſt</hi> ſignifies God and Man as they ſay, and both of them were Anointed; wherefore the Name is applicable to both) that there are three Names; the firſt is he who applies the Oyntment; the ſecond ſignifies the Operation it ſelf, and the third him to whom it was applied: Wherefore if the Name <hi>[Chriſt]</hi> ſignifies both God and Man, then according to their ſaying, Man is Anointed, and God alſo is Anointed; and if it be ſo, wherefore do ye fly from what ye ſay, <hi>That the Word of God is Anointed of the Father by the Holy Ghoſt, as he was Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, if the Name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſignifies God and Man, there ſeems to be two Chriſt, and not one; as the Name <hi>Horſe</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Land-Horſe</hi> and a <hi>Sea-Horſe,</hi> and each of them pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly, and again both of them together, and both of them are called Horſes; ſo then when ye ſay, That <hi>Man is Anointed,</hi> and <hi>God Anointed him,</hi> therefore ye call him <hi>Anointed, Anointing,</hi> and <hi>Oyntment,</hi> and not Anointed only. And that ye ſay, that Man who was Anointed, being in Union with the Word, and communicating unto the <hi>Word</hi> this Name of being called <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:37030:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>or <hi>Anointed,</hi> it were fitting that the Word alſo ſhould commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate unto Man his Name of being called <hi>One Anointing,</hi> for which Reaſon we call the Word of God Chriſt; not that he is, but that he was made Man; and he is not Earthly who was made Man, but Heavenly who was made Earthly, as he ſaid, that <hi>he came down from Heaven, and was to go to his own:</hi> The Doctors alſo ſpeak in Confirmation of this, that <hi>the Word is called Chriſt, and that he was anointed by the Spirit in as much as he was made Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gregory Nyſſen ſaith, the holy Ghoſt calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the Anointing of the only Son of God a Divine Word;</hi> and a little after, <hi>If therefore</hi> Chriſt <hi>be the only Son of God,</hi> and <hi>Anointing</hi> be the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> the Name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſignifies <hi>Regal Authority,</hi> for <hi>Anointing</hi> is a ſign of Regality, the holy Ghoſt alſo communicates of the Power. John (Chryſoſtom) in his Expoſition on the Gallatians, ſaith <hi>he</hi> is called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering his People from their Sins; and alſo hints by the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Anointing</hi> of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Severus in the forty ſecond Chapter againſt Grammaticus, <hi>It being ſaid after the manner of Men, that he was</hi> Anointed, <hi>We all are they who are Anointed in him, for he being baptized, we are they who are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. Philoxenus, <hi>He is therefore called Chriſt, becauſe the Father by the Spirit revealed that he was his Son by Nature, and that He is God as He is Himſelf; according as he ſaid,</hi> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyme, O Father, with the Glory which I had with thee; <hi>and a Voice was heard,</hi> I have glorified, and will glorify; <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Spirit he ſaid,</hi> When the holy Ghoſt ſhall come, he will glorify me.</p>
               <p>But when was Chriſt Anointed? Whether in the Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or before he was Conceived, or after he was Born?</p>
               <p>The Hereticks ſay, After he was born of the Virgin; but they are not in the Truth; and it is manifeſt from hence, that Mathew ſaith, <hi>The Book of the Birth of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for hereby he ſheweth that he was born being Chriſt; but ſome of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſay, that he was Anointed before he was Conceived in the Womb, becauſe they call his Miſsion from the Father his Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, according to what he ſaid, <hi>Whom the Father ſanctified,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37030:23"/>and ſent into the World,</hi> and who aſcended into heaven, and brought down Chriſt. But we ſay, That the Word was Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the very Conception in the Womb of the Virgin; for in as much as the Spirit deſcended into the Womb, and purified her, and formed of her a Body to the Word, he anointed and ſanctified the Body, and the Word was united thereunto perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; and that is evident from this, That <hi>the holy Ghoſt ſhall come, and the power of the moſt High ſhall dwell upon thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Generation of Jeſus Chriſt was thus]</hi> It hath been ſhewed to the Hearers, That Chriſt was to come when the Princes of the People ſhould fail, and the Seventy Weeks of Daniel ſhould be accompliſhed; here he teaches the manner of his Corporeal Birth. When thou Husband ſhalt hear this, do not think that he is to be born according to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who preſcribes a Law to Nature; and when he came to Joſeph, he ſaid, <hi>who begat Chriſt;</hi> and therefore he ſaith af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, That <hi>the Generation of Jeſus Chriſt was thus;</hi> that is to ſay, he was not born as all other men, but this his Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was of a new kind, and it was above the nature of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Generations; wherefore he ſaid it was thus, that he might expound the Novelty of that kind of Generation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When Mary his Mother was eſpouſed to Joſeph]</hi> They were Eſpouſed, but without Marital Conjunction; and before ſuch Aſſociation ſhe was found to have Conceived, wherefore did ſhe not Conceive before ſhe was Betrothed?</p>
               <p>That this matter might be concealed from the Prince of the World; for Satan did not know from the manner of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, that it was God who was incarnated; for St. Ignatius ſaith, That <hi>this Prince Erred in the Virginity of Mary, and in the Birth and Death of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Mary did not conceive before the Eſpouſals, that the matter might be concealed from the Jewes, and that the Virgin her ſelf might be free from puniſhment, that under the name of a bounden huſband, ſhe might not be ſtoned as a whore, and becauſe the Genealogies were not written in the name of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, therefore ſhe aſſumed the name of a Spouſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Before they came together,</hi> he ſaith, that ſhe was found to have conceived, but not before her coming to his houſe, for ſhe was
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37030:24"/>in his houſe, for alſo the Sons in Law of Lott dwelt in his houſe, and Jacob dwelt with his ſpouſe in the houſe of Laban, and ſo the Virgin dwelt with Joſeph in his houſe; for it was the Cuſtom for Women betrothed to dwell with their Husbands for the ſpace of three years, and afterwards they came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to ſhew thereby that they came together not as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of luſt, but for the procreation of Children, who repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them as the Reward, Wages, and Fruit of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>She had need of a betrothed Husband, that he might be an Help and Protection to her from the Jews, who obſerving her to be with Child, might have thought her to be with Child by her reputed Husband, and ſo forbear to ſtone her; and that he might flee away with her, when Herod deſigned to deſtroy the Child; and that the Virgin might not ſuffer diſgrace; for it was a ſhame for a Woman to remain without a Husband among the Jews, as ſaid Iſaiah, <hi>Onely let us be called by thy Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, whoever was a Votary amongſt the Jews, was Unmarried; and the Virgin being a Votary, eſpouſed Joſeph, being well ſtricken in years, that no thought might ariſe againſt her, like to the common deſire of an Husband amongſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>And it is manifeſt from hence, that Joſhua the Son of Nun, who was a Votary, did not redeem himſelf for a Price, and therefore took no Wife.</p>
               <p>But to what kind of Betrothing was ſhe Eſpouſed?</p>
               <p>Gregory Nyſſen, St. Athanaſius, and Jacobus Aurienſis ſay, It was by way of Cuſtody, and that by Command of the Prieſts, becauſe ſhe was a Votary; and it is known from this, that in one of the Copies it is written, that <hi>ſhe knew not man;</hi> but Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobus Sarugenſis, and St. Severus, ſay, that ſhe was eſpouſed in reference to Marriage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Before they came together]</hi> That is to ſay, they had ſcarce aſſociated, or had almoſt aſſociated, when this Miracle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Concubition; And moreover, it is known, that he eſpou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed her as to Marriage, becauſe that when ſhe conceived, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph was not accuſed as one who had violated his Vow to God, for Joſeph was not far from aſſociation.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:37030:24"/>

                  <hi>She was found to have Conceived]</hi> That is to ſay, ſhe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Joſeph to have Conceived. Perhaps, ſome one might doubt where, and how; for it is the nature of <hi>Women</hi> to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from <hi>Men;</hi> but ſhe Conceived without knowledge of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Conſociation; But he briefly reſolves the doubt, ſaying, <hi>From the holy Spirit.</hi> In that he ſaid the <hi>Spirit,</hi> he ſhews that ſhe did not Conceive of any other humane Conſociation beſides Joſephs; and in as much as he ſaid <hi>the holy Spirit,</hi> he ſhewed that ſhe did not conceive of an ordinary or accidental Spirit; for ſometimes VVomen conceive certain kinds of Accidental Winds, as ſaid Iſaiah, <hi>They conceived and brought forth, as they who brought forth Windes.</hi> The word <hi>from,</hi> is ſaid in many ſences; <hi>naturally,</hi> as the Beams are ſaid to be from the Sun; by way of generation of what is generated, as the Son from the Father Eternally; Efficiently, as a Stool from a Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; by way of Creation, as the Creature from the Creator, and other ways: But here the vvords, <hi>From the holy Spirit,</hi> are taken efficiently, for the Body was framed and made by the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> and ſo the Word was united thereunto, and by the holy ghoſt, that is to ſay, the Spirit of Omnipotent Power, who from the beginning framed the firſt Man of Earth without Copulation, and took Eve out of his ſide, and made the Rod to bud forth, and made Waters ſpring from the Rock, and from an Arid, that is to ſay, a dry Cheek, and from a Tree a Ram, and from a Root Children; and here he of the Virgin framed pure Body for the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, This Body united to the Word was from the Virgin, becauſe ſhe afforded whatever Women contribute to the framing of a Body; and he was from the Spirit, becauſe the Spirit ſupplied the part of a Man, and created it, framed it, and anointed it; and the Word was united perſonally to the Son. But thou when thou heareſt that the Spirit did this, believe, and be confirmed, and do not curiouſly enquire: Nor were Gabriel, and Mathew able to ſay, how this was done; for, it was a miracle beyond Comprehenſion, they declared onely who did it, but how it was done, they were not able to explain.</p>
               <p>St. Cyril: It is demanded, when the Word was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and incarnated of the Virgin, why was it that the holy-Ghoſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37030:25"/>for that cauſe ſhould come unto her, that he might take from her that Curſe, <hi>In ſorrow ſhalt thou bring forth Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> and that he might purifie her, and Sanctifie her, and fill up the place of a Man, and conſtitute into one perſon with the word this holy body, and that he might receive it firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſeph was a juſt Man, and unwilling to put her to Shame.</hi> It is therefore here called Juſtice, not to defame, or diſgrace a Man, and he who hath one Species of Juſtice, is juſtly ſaid to be juſt, and here he doth not call juſt, one that is Adorned with all Vertues, and behold Juſtice was contrary to the Law, which ſaith. <hi>Thy Hand ſhall be firſt upon her;</hi> he knew, that either ſhe was Innocent or Faulty; if Faulty, it was his Duty to put her to Shame, and to Accuſe her; and if Innocent, to keep her with him, and to be careful of her; but he was Juſt, and Merciful, his Juſtice did not permit him to maintain a Whore in his Houſe, and Pity Councelled him to diſmiſs her privily, and therefore he thought to ſend here away privily: And therefore he thought to ſend her away ſecretly, that he might not ſeem to cohabit with a guilty perſon, or to be a Tranſgreſſor of the Law. And he ſent her thus privily away, as having compaſſion on her, that ſhe might not be diſgraced, and condemned to death.</p>
               <p>Again, he was Juſt in this Reſpect, that he did not Diſgrace her, becauſe he knew no Sin in her.</p>
               <p>Moreover, for that he had heard of Elizabeths being with Child, of Zacharias loſs of Speech, and of John's Exaltation, and he thought alſo that this was a Miracle, and therefore he did not repute her a Whore, though he did not detain her as Righteous.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, That there is ſaid to be a two-fold Juſtice, the one is that which gives unto every Man according to his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the other is Grace, which doth not Revenge Offences, but forgiveth. So one is ſaid to be Juſt two manner of ways, the one is of the Law, who giveth blow for blow, the other is of the Goſpel, who Bleſſeth him who Curſeth him; ſuch a Righteous Man was Joſeph, who in his Mercy, which was his Juſtice, was minded to ſend her privily away.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:37030:25"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>He was minded to ſend her privily away,</hi> when as the Jews knew nothing hereof: When he diſcerned that ſhe was with Child, he demanded whence ſhe came to be with Child; and ſhe anſwered of the Spirit: But he ſtood in doubt, as ſaith Jacobus Batenenſis; if it were from the Spirit, he ought not to come near unto her; and if from an Adulterer, his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs was not to be joyned with the Body of one guilty of Fornication: He was minded therefore to diſmiſs her privately that the Jews might not put her to death, and that he might not be guilty.</p>
               <p>Others ſay that Mary ſaid nothing unto him, as knowing that he would not believe her words, for it was a wonderful thing; and moreover, that he would be troubled in mind at the hearing of it; ſhe was alſo perſwaded, that he who was pleaſed to be incarnated from her, would plead her excuſe, and ſhe thought it not decent to reveal ſuch a myſtery as this that the Angel had whiſpered unto her; he that is faithful in his ſpirit conceals a matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whileſt he meditated on theſe things,</hi> that is to ſay, to diſmiſs her privily, that the Jews might not take notice and ſtone her, and that ſhe might not be blamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There appeared unto him in a dream the Angel of the Lord, and ſaid unto him.</hi> Wherefore did not the Angel appear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly to Joſeph, as he did to Zachary, to the Virgin, and to the Shepherds? Becauſe he was one ready to believe, and needed not a manifeſt Viſion; as witneſſeth this, that he doubted not after the Viſion of the Angel; he appeared likewiſe to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, by reaſon of the difficulty of the thing; and for that it was ſupernatural to the Shepherds alſo, becauſe they were rude and ſimple Perſons: For Dreams are manifeſted in ſundry kinds, either from God, as the Dreams of Joſeph, of Pharaoh, and Nebuchadnezzar, and Daniel, and of Pilate's Wife; or from Satan, as the imaginations of Phancy, by an Operation tranſporting the Soul out of a correſpondency with the Body, not differing from the Phantaſms of Sleep, and offending the Brain, as alſo the Spirits, and ſtupifying the Underſtanding, which they call Frenſie; or from the Cogitations of the day, as whatſoever a man doth, or meditates on in the day, occurres to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37030:26"/>him in his dream, or from ſome predominant Temper, as ſay the Phyſitians; for if Blood be predominant in a man, he ſees ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and effuſion of blood; and if Melancholly, he ſees darkneſs, and caves, and ſolitary houſes, and all things that import fear and terror; and if Phlegm, he ſees rain, rivers and running brooks; and if Choller, he ſees fire, the Sun, the Sun Beames, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagrations, and in other manners are dreams ſeen.</p>
               <p>Joſeph's Dream here was from God: Wherefore did not the Angel come unto Joſeph before he meditated on theſe things?</p>
               <p>We ſay that he permited him to put her away, that he might not doubt, or be like Zachary; but when as ſhe had conceived, and the Angel ſoon made faith thereof, he eaſily believed; but Mary therefore held her peace, and did not publiſh it, becauſe ſhe conceived he would not give credit to her words; for that the woman was already ſubject to capital puniſhment, if he had heard ſuch like a matter.</p>
               <p>The Angel came to the Virgin before ſhe conceived, that ſhe might not be ſurprized by the change of condition, for, if ſhe had conceived without having had notice thereof before-hand, ſhe not knowing from whence ſhe did Conceive, had murdered her ſelf, that ſhe might have eſcaped from reproach, or had dyed for grief; but he did not come before to Joſeph to tell him of it, as he did to Zacharie, becauſe he would not have believed, and the ſame would have happned as in the caſe of Zacharie.</p>
               <p>Moreover, he hearing that it was from the Spirit, he had fled from her as from a deſcending fire; and had not dwelt with her.</p>
               <p>And moreover, it was fitting that the Mother of the Child ſhould perceive it before others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſeph the Son of David,</hi> he calls him rhe Son of David, and not the Son of Jacob, or the Son of Heli. aceording to the Law, to put him in mind of the Promiſe made to David, and that it was he who had the Promiſe, that he ſhould ſpring from his Seed, as is ſaid by the Prophets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fear not to take Mary thy Wife,</hi> by the Words <hi>fear not,</hi> he exempted him from fear; for, Joſeph was afraid that he might have ſinned before God, in taking unto him an Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Wife, but the Angel encourages him in taking away the doubt which he had in his mind, and ſhewed that he was ſent from God.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:37030:26"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>To take Mary,</hi> That is to ſay, to keep her with thee, for in thy Reſolution thou haſt ſent her away, becauſe God now delivers her unto thee, and not her Parents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thy Wife,</hi> He calls her his Wife, to ſignifie, that ſhe was not an Adultereſs, for, had ſhe been an Adultereſs, he had not called her his Wife; for it is certain, That one is called a Mans Wife, rather from betrothing, than Conſociation; for, though a Man accompany himſelf with an Adultereſs, ſhe is not called his Wife; neither doth he perſwade him to approach unto her, in ſaying, <hi>Fear not to take her,</hi> but he ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou ſhalt not fear to come near unto her,</hi> as conceiving her to be an Adultereſs; but as thinking her to have conceived from the holy Ghoſt, Sanctifie thy ſelf before thou approach unto her.</p>
               <p>Again, He calls a Spouſe a Wife, as it is written in the Law, and as the Scripture is uſed to call one but betrothed Son-in-Law; and as he called Mary the Mother of John before ſhe bore him. So doth the Angel call Mary the Wife of Joſeph, though he knew her not: the Angel doth not threaten Joſeph as he did Abimelech, becauſe the Adminiſtration to Joſeph was great, and much differing from the other, and Joſeph was confirmed by him, who revealed unto him his thoughts, and by the promiſe which he made to David, and by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Eſaiah to the Houſe of David, and from the Majeſty of the Generation, and over and above theſe Conſiderations, he added a Declaration whence ſhe Conceived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For he who is begotten in her, is from the Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> The Power therefore of the Moſt High, that is to ſay, <hi>God the Word,</hi> being to be United to the Fleſh dwelling in the Virgin, the Holy-Ghoſt firſt Sanctified the Word, and framed into one Perſon with the Word, his Holy Body; for always the Spirit creates with the Word, according to this, That by the Word of the Lord they were made; and, Thou ſendeſt thy Spirit, and they are Tormented: for theſe Words, <hi>Begotten in her,</hi> in this place ſignifie as much, as Conceived in her, for if the Word Birth, or Nativity, be ſaid of remote things as this, I know not what to morrow will bring forth, and the reſt of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37030:27"/>other, the like places whereof we have ſpoken formerly, it is certain, that Conception may be ſpoken of Nativity.</p>
               <p>Moreover, to ſhew, That this Child was not of the Seed of Man, nor yet of Maries own Concupiſcential Seed, but of the Holy-Ghoſt, and of the Virgins own Body, for he ſaith, <hi>Born in her,</hi> and not <hi>from her;</hi> for, he doth not ſpeak a Man newly created, but of God Incorporated, for we, becauſe we took beginning from our Mothers, are ſaid to be from them, as having had no other being before, but he, becauſe he was before, yet Conceived in her, and not Born before; the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſaid, <hi>in her,</hi> but the Words <hi>from her,</hi> are ſaid of meer Man, who derived his beginning from a Woman, and becauſe he had no being, 'tis ſaid, that he is born from her; and <hi>in her,</hi> is ſaid of God, who was from the beginning, and dwelt in the Virgin; therefore, becauſe it was God, who was Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Angel ſaid <hi>in her,</hi> who had an Eternal being beyond all times, and becauſe he was incorporated, he ſaid, that he was born in her. Concerning the Word <hi>from,</hi> we have before ſet forth how many ways it is taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> that is to ſay, as his Creature; and his work, for the Body of Chriſt is from the Holy Ghoſt, not by way of Generation, for whatever is Generated, is Fleſh from Fleſh, and whatever is from Spirit, is Spirit, though not yet naturally, for it is above Nature, when the effect doth not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of the ſame Eſſence in Generation. It remains therefore, That he was from the Spirit, as his Creature. Saint Severus, For the Spirit made the Child, after the manner of one who gives Shape and Figure to things.</p>
               <p>But Mary contributed without deficiency whatever belongs to women of their own nature to contribute to generation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deficiency, except ſin and Concupiſcence, becauſe Adam and his wife fell by Concupiſcence of the Tree, therefore the being and generation of their children was alſo by Concupiſcence; and God the Word being minded to renew our decayed inveterate nature, it was fit that there ſhould be nothing of Concupiſcence in his conception.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſhall bring forth a Son</hi> He did not ſay, <hi>to thee,</hi> becauſe he was not born to him, but to the whole world, and again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37030:27"/>he had nothing to do with his generation he did not ſay, to thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus</hi> That is to ſay, though he were not his own Son, yet for as much as fathers impoſed names on their Children, I give thee authority to impoſe a name on him, that thou mayeſt not be made a ſtranger to the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration: And it was ſaid of Joſeph in the Maſculine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt call his name;</hi> but Luke ſaid that the Angel ſpake to Mary in the feminine gender, <hi>Thou ſhalt call;</hi> and theſe are not contradictory, becauſe it is the part of the Father and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to give names. <hi>Jeſus</hi> is expounded <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and that we might not think him to be a ſenſible Saviour, and that he was to free us from bodily bondage he ſayed,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For he ſhall quicken his people from their ſins,</hi> he did not ſay, who ſhall <hi>redeem,</hi> for he came to revive thoſe who were dead in ſins; and he did not ſay the Gentiles, that Joſeph might not be grieved at the paſſing of a Redeemer from the Jewes to the Gentiles, as it happened unto Jonas. But the Intelligent know that not only the Jews, but alſo all they who imbrace his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, are his people, according to that, <hi>The Gentiles ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how did he ſave his people? By Faith in him, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and Repentance.</p>
               <p>Moreover in as much as he ſaid <hi>his people,</hi> he gave notice before hand of his power and coequality with his Father, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the people of the Jewes, <hi>his people;</hi> as alſo he is ſaid to be Father of his people; for theſe two things belong to God and not to man, that the people ſhould be his; as it is written, <hi>That the People of Iſreal is the Portion of the Lord,</hi> and to <hi>quicken his people from ſins;</hi> as ſaid the Jews, <hi>It is God only who forgiveth ſins;</hi> wherefore Chriſt is God who was made man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All this was done;</hi> that is to ſay, becauſe Joſeph wondered at this matter, he ſaid, <hi>All this was done.</hi> And what was all this? The Virgin who conceived without carnal Copulation, God, who became a humane Child without being changed, the middle wall of Partition broken down, Reconciliation made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man; and ye are not to think this as a new
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37030:28"/>thing, for it was manifeſted many Ages paſt in Types and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries; and therefore he ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it might be fullfilled which was ſay'd of the Lord by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;</hi> that is to ſay, The Angel doth not ſet this down as the cauſe, as if a man ſhould ſay, that the Lord did this becauſe Eſaiah ſay'd it, but becauſe what he was to do he ſignified unto Eſaiah, and he propheſied; for by this, <hi>What was ſay'd of the Lord,</hi> he ſignifies, That theſe were the Words and Speech of the Lord; and by theſe words, <hi>by the Prophet,</hi> he declares that the prophet was the Organ of the Lord; that although Eſaiah ſpoke theſe words, yet they deſcended from on high: And he produceth this Teſtimony, to teach that this Adminiſtration was anciently promiſed, and to make it clear that the Conception of the Virgin was not adulterous, but as Iſaiah propheſied, <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive;</hi> and if it chance that thou ſhalt forget the Dream when thou ſhalt awake, in remembring the words of the Prophet, thou ſhalt call to mind the Viſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For behold a Virgin ſhall conceive, and bring forth a Son:</hi> A Jew will ſay that other Interpreters render it a <hi>young Woman,</hi> and not Virgin: Unto whom we ſay, That the Seventy Two are true, and more to be relyed on than all other Interpreters, firſt of all for their Number, their Truth, and Agreement of their Words; ſecondly, becauſe they made their Interpretations long before the coming of Chriſt, and are free from all ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Fraud; but thoſe Interpreters who followed after, are of leſs eſteem, becauſe they interpreted after Chriſt, and being in Judaiſm hated Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Moreover, theſe words, <hi>A Virgin ſhall conceive,</hi> the Lord gave as a Sign unto Achaz, and how had it been a ſign that a young Woman ſhould bring forth with carnal knowledge? For a Sign is a Work above Nature.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the Scripture uſually calls Virgins young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for it ſaith, <hi>The young Woman went forth to fill Water;</hi> and in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> it is written concerning a Virgin that is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, <hi>The young Woman becauſe ſhe did not cry out;</hi> and the young Women were Virgins whom the Benjamites Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed.</p>

                  <hi>And they ſhall call his Name Emanuel, which is interpreted God with us.</hi> He did not ſay, <hi>Thou ſhalt call,</hi> but <hi>they</hi> ſhall call, that is to ſay, from his Works it ſhall be known, that it is God who came unto us, who ſhall converſe bodily with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which is interpreted;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Expounded,</hi> and he hath been called Emanuel by approved Doctors, and Doctors are Men; and this is like to that of Zacharie; behold a Man, and his Name is a <hi>Branch,</hi> or <hi>Splendor,</hi> where alſo from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact it was known, that he was the Light and Splendor which aroſe to thoſe who ſate in Darkneſs, though not by Name ſo called.</p>
               <p>And if the Jews ſhall ſay, That Chriſt was not called Emanuel by Men, let us ask them, when was Eſaiah called by the Name of, <hi>Swift to Captivity, and given to Prey?</hi> But they cannot ſhew it unleſs by matter of Fact; becauſe of the Captivity and Prey which happened in his days, he might have had that Name.</p>
               <p>It is Written alſo concerning Hieruſalem, That it ſhall be called the City of Righteouſneſs, and the City of Fidelity; yet we have obſerved it not to be ſo named, but it retained the Name Hieruſalem, though from matter of Fact it might have been denominated from thoſe two Qualities.</p>
               <p>In like manner it is as to Emanuel, whom the Prophet Names ſo from matter of Fact; That is, becauſe he converſed with us bodily; for it is the Cuſtom of the Scripture to uſe the thing done inſtead of a Name: Emanuel ſignifies God who converſed openly with Men; and if they ſhall ſay, that he alſo converſed with the Juſt, according as he ſaid to Jeſus; <hi>as I have been with Moſes, ſo will I be with thee,</hi> by way of Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and is not there called Emanuel; We ſay, That here he ſpeaks concerning his bodily Nativity, being made Man, and converſant with us on Earth.</p>
               <p>Moreover, The Angel ſaid Emanuel, that is to ſay, <hi>God with us, and not God with him,</hi> as Wicked Neſtorious would have it, for the Word is not only United to one Man, Framed, Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and Segregated, but alſo hath drawn and collected by the power of his Operation, our whole Nature into Union with himſelf.</p>

               <p>That ſhe remained a Virgin after ſhe brought forth, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the common opinion of Men; for as God being
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:37030:30"/>born of her was not changed, ſo the Virginity of her who bare him was not loſt, for ſhe was not corrupted; for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture calleth her <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefiled in Marriage;</hi> and Zachary in the Temple ranketh her with the Virgins.</p>
               <p>The Heretick ſaith, <hi>If he did not diſſolve Virginity, neither did he aſſume a Body; and if he did aſſume a Body, therefore did he diſsolve Virginity in his Exit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we anſwer, That if God confirmed the Mother of God a Virgin, ſo that ſhe remained in Virginity after bringing forth, it was alſo a Miracle that ſhe being a Virgin did bring forth: And if thou requireſt proof or illuſtration, hear how he came forth of the Sepulcher unopened, and entered into the Parlour being ſhut up: So he came forth of the Womb not prejudicing Virginity.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, that a Body penetrated a Body without any open paſſage, we have ſhewed many ways, as Eves coming out of the ſide of Adam, the Waters which flowed from the Rock, the Waters which ſprung from the Jaw-bone of an Aſs, how much rather then did he who is incorporeal, come forth in his Birth from the Virgin, without corrupting of her Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Her firſt-born Son:</hi> Not that ſhe brought forth any one after him, but he is called the <hi>firſt-born,</hi> becauſe he was firſt in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, for the Scripture is uſed to call him the <hi>firſt-born</hi> who openeth the Womb, according to that, <hi>Every one who openeth the Womb, ſhall be called Holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scripture calleth one the <hi>firſt-born,</hi> before he have Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; ſo our Saviour: Altho' Joſes, and James, and others, were called his Brethren, yet they were not called ſo as being born of the Virgin, but becauſe they were the Sons of Joſeph by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wife, and they were in the way of his diſpenſation called his brethren, as Joſeph was called his Father; and Chriſt is ſay'd to be firſt born, four ſeveral ways, firſt as ſaith ſaint Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew by opening the womb, and he doth not call him <hi>her</hi> firſt born onely, for he was not onely the firſt born of Mary, but of all creatures.</p>

               <p>Moreover, becauſe we were made guilty by Eve; it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that we ſhould be made righteous by a Virgin; and as the World was born of a Virgin above nature, ſo alſo he begat us from baptiſm above nature.</p>
               <p>And how could a Virgin bring forth? We Anſwer, that what things are impoſſible with us, are poſſible with God; and in Luke we have written fully concerning this Matter.</p>
               <p>Wherefore was he born of a Virgin betrothed? That Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins might not be Exalted above marryed women, and that it might be known, that marriage was commanded by God, and not by Satan, as the Heritick Maries taught.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is known to be God from hence, that his nativity is not written as others are, and for that he was begotten without Carnal Copulation: And becauſe he was Incorporated by the Holy-Ghoſt, and for that he was born of a Virgin who kept her Virginity, for that he Accompliſh'd Promiſes and Prophecies.</p>
               <p>Moreover, for that he reviv'd Men from their Sins, for that he got a Name before he was born, and for that he was called Emanuel, which is Interpreted, <hi>God with us;</hi> for after Mathew had finiſhed his Diſcourſe on the kind of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, he begins to ſhew, how he was Born, and what things were done at his Birth, which do not a little manifeſt his Majeſty and Deity.</p>

               <p>Moreover, it is fitting to take notice, That Kings Reigned from David to the Captivity, and after the Captivity the High Prieſts Aſſumed the Government, who were of the Tribe of Levi, but their Genealogy was deduced from Judah, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the commixture of the Tribe of Levi; eſpecially of the High-Prieſts with the Royal Tribe of Judah.

               <p>He was Revealed to the Wiſe-Men rather than to others, becauſe he came to call Sinners, the Wiſe-Men were more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected then all other. Nations with Idolatry, and they uſed

               <p>Others, That in the time of Daniel, when Nebuchadnezar Reigned, there came Men from Sheba to offer Gifts unto the King, and to learn Aſtrology, and Daniel faid unto them, <hi>When Chriſt ſhall be born, your Kings of Seba, and Sheba

               <p>Others, That Aſdruſhta the Southſayer, foreſhewed this, and others ſay it was Baruch, and becauſe the Gift of Prophecy was not beſtowed on him, he was offended, and departed to the Gentiles, and taught twelve Tongues.

               <p>Others ſay, That when Daniel's Family was carried Captive unto <hi>Babylon,</hi> they did read this, <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah,</hi> and the Prophecy of <hi>Balaam, that a Star ſhall ariſe,</hi> and this, The Kings of Sheba, &amp;c. which David ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sons of the Kings of Perſia, of Sheba, and of Seba, who were Neighbouring Princes, and they ask'd the Hebrews concerning whom theſe things were ſaid, and Daniel and his fellows Anſwered, Concerning Chriſt, and that in the day of his Nativity a Star ſhould ariſe which would ſhine as the Sun and they kept theſe things to themſelves, and when they returned to their places, they committed this Myſtery to writing, and it was derived by Tradition until the birth of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Lord John ſaith, That God put it into their Hearts, and made them take Gifts, and to ſollow the Star, as he made Cyrus, inciting to lead the Jews into Captivity. And the Wiſe Men came from the Eaſt to Chriſt, becauſe Paradice was plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Eaſt, and the Sun begins its Courſe from the Eaſt. So alſo from the Eaſt begins the Sun of Righteouſneſs, and becauſe they were to bring Gold, and there was no Gold like that of this part of the World, the Scripture ſaying, that <hi>the Gold of this Land is good,</hi> and the Prophets Prophecied, that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:37030:34"/>
                  <hi>the Wiſe-Men ſhould come from the Sun Riſing to the Sun Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> and Malachy, <hi>that from the Eaſt thereof,</hi> and at his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming, he is to come from the Eaſt, and at the time of our Lords coming, the Perſians Ruled from Niſibis to the Eaſt and from Niſibis to the Weſt the Romans, and God ſo ordered it, that at that time there ſhould be Peace between them, that the Wiſe Men might not be hindered in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where is the King of the Jews born?</hi> That is to ſay, they do not enquire after a King Sitting upon a Throne, as if his time were already, but after him of whom Eſaiah ſaith, <hi>That there ſhall be a Root of Jeſſe which ſhall Riſe as a Sign to the Gentiles, and in him ſhall the Nations hope, and he is the hope of all the ends of the Earth;</hi> We ſeek him who is now born, and not Herod, and they ſaid not where is the Son of God, for Frankincenſe was a Figure of him, becauſe the Jews expected a King, and a Redeemer, therefore they ſpoke of a King.</p>
               <p>Again, the Names of Chriſt are threefold, of Excellency as God, the Son of God, and Lord; of a middle Nature, as King, Redeemer, and Ruler. Of low condition, as the Son of Man, Man, and Servant: The Wiſe-Men made uſe of a Name of middle Nature, calling him King, as more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it being the beginning of his Government, and Supere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, or low Names, were not very acceptable.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, They enquired after a King, becauſe Micah called him King, <hi>from thee ſhall go forth a King</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For we have ſeen in his Star in the Eaſt, and are come to Worſhip him.</hi> He drew the Wiſe-Men by a Star, condeſcending with their weakneſs in what was accuſtomable unto them, for, as they declared the Death of Saul by Sorcerers, and taught Balaam his Power by thoſe things he did unto Balak, and as he allured the Children of Iſrael by Sacrifices which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected according to the cuſtom of the Heathens in Egypt, and as he took the Apoſtles by the taking of Fiſhes, and as Paul did when he ſpake with the Gentiles who produced an Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration from Ports; and as Fowl is taken by ſcattering before them what they are accuſtomed unto; ſo did he unto the Wiſe-Men; he firſt calls them by a Star, and afterwards by an
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:37030:35"/>Angel ſpeaks with them, and ſo draws them by degrees unto Vertue.</p>
               <p>So he did unto the Philiſtians when they cut their Buttocks, and called their South ſayers, and ſaid yoak Heifers under the Ark, and the Plague is known, if ſuch an one, it is from God, and if ſuch an one, it is by chance; and if God be Counſelled of Sorcerers, it was not thought a ſhame unto him that Enemies ſhould Teſtifie unto Truth; ſo the Wiſe-Men by Stars after which they wandered, foreſhewed his Nativity.</p>
               <p>And again, becauſe he was of an Heavenly Nature, he hooked them up by a Star of Heaven, who alſo calls the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his dwelling.</p>
               <p>Moreover, he drew them by a Star, according to the word of Balaam who called him a <hi>Star,</hi> and Eſaiah <hi>Light,</hi> and Malachi, <hi>the Sun,</hi> and Jeremiah <hi>a ſprout of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and our Lord calls himſelf Light.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, That they might be lighted to the Sun Chriſt by a Star, and therefore when they attained the Sun, the Star was ſwallowed up in obſcurity, for, it is the Nature of a Star to diſappear when the Sun ſhines in its Brightneſs; ſo Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Chaldaiſme alſo ceaſed, for, among the Perſians, a Star was reputed a God, which was called <hi>Nain,</hi> and by that which was true in their conceipt, he allured them to the Truth.</p>
               <p>Again, three bodily Preachers Preached him, the Star, becauſe he was Heavenly, the Shepherds, becauſe he was a Shepherd, and a Lamb, the Wiſe-Men, becauſe he was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for Sins.</p>
               <p>Moreover, He declared his Divinity by a Star, and that he was altogether High, and Sublime who was born, whoſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, and Nuncioes were ſuch as by the Wiſe-Men were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Gods; and as before the ſenſible Sun, the Morning Star Aſcends, ſo before the Rational Sun, a Star was the Herauld, and that he might ſhew that he was the Creator of all the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, Old and Spiritual, for in that he began firſt with Light, and in this he drew the VViſe-Men with a Star, neither was it a Star indeed which appeared to the VViſe Men, for, it is known that it deſcended, and ſtood over the Houſe, for that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37030:35"/>it deſcended, is as much as that it leſt its ſublime ſtation, and came down very near over the place, otherwiſe it could not have diſtinctly indicated the place as with a Finger; for behold the Moon, which is greater than the Star, remaining in one place, ſeems to be over many and ſundry Places, not being able to ſhew one of them diſtinctly; and this Star, if it deſcended, and diſtinctly ſhewed the place, it is evident that it was no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Star, but one of the ſublime hoſt: And to theſe agree Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril, Johannes, and Theodotus Ankorenſis.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, there are two ſorts of Stars, ſome of them are fixed in a Sphere, and are in an immovable ſtation, ſome of them never ceaſe from motion, this moved, going before the wiſe men, and ſtood, thereby demonſtrating the Place, and ſometimes went on, and ſometimes ſtood ſtill, wherefore it was no natural Star.</p>
               <p>And furthermore, the Stars in the Sphear ſome of them proceed from Eaſt to Weſt, and the wandring Stars from VVeſt to Eaſt; but this held its courſe from North-Eaſt to South-weſt, for ſo is Perſia ſituated, in relation to Paleſtine: And natural Stars are not uſually ſeen in the day time; but this appeared night and day, which is not agreeable to the nature of Stars: For when they came to Jeruſalem it diſappeared, and when they departed thence it manifeſted it ſelf; and from that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the wiſe men, and not into others, and afforded light indifferently day and night; and from that it did ſhine and not burn, being deſcended very far from the place of Coeleſtial Stars, to direct the wiſe men in the way, as with the ſinger; and from that that it overcame the Beams of the Sun with its bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when the Sun was in its Meridional Altitude; We ſay it was no natural Star. Whence therefore was it?</p>
               <p>Some ſay that it was a concealed power of the Lord that appeared in the ſimilitude of an Angel others, as we have ſaid before, one of the Angels aſſumed the likeneſs of a Star, and was conſtellated and led the wiſe Men, and it was not a phantaſme or Automaton that is to ſay of its ſelf. Moreover, it is known to have been no natural Star from this, that it held its progreſs from Eaſt to Weſt for ſo Perſia is placed in poſition on the Eaſt of Hieruſalem, and Hieruſalem on the Weſt of Perſia. Others
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37030:36"/>ſay, that it proceeded from the South-Eaſt to the North, and from the North to the weſt, for ſo was the Courſe from Perſia to Paleſtine; and when they entred into one of the Cities or Towns, it was obſcured; and this was as it were by way of Queſtion and Anſwer, that the Nativity of Chriſt might be made known; nor had it a progreſſive indication, but when it behoved them to proceed; It did proceed like to the Pillar of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>Some men deſirous to eſtabliſh the Caldean Learning, ſay, Behold a Star appeared when Chriſt was born; againſt whom we ſay, that if the Aſtrologers ſay that he was born by this Power, how did he ſuddenly deſtroy Caldaiſm, and the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies thereof? And mens Nativities are not calculated by one Star, but by many, by Twelve or Seven.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, Aſtrologers from the Stars fore-tell concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mans Kingdom, or what befalls him, as their Judgment, and perhaps ſome may ſay, that ſo they made this computation concerning the King of the Jews.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to whom we ſay, Behold he ſaid, <hi>My Kingdom was not of the World;</hi> neither had he Miniſters, nor Army, not Houſe.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Caldaiſme doth not eſtabliſh a Nativity upon one Star, but from the ſeven Wanderers, which are called Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, which do not ſtick to the Body of the Heaven, that is to ſay, <hi>The Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Bell,</hi> that is <hi>Jupiter, Balti,</hi> which is <hi>Aphrodite, Saturu,</hi> who is <hi>Cheon;</hi> and from the Twelve Signs of the Zodiack in Heaven, <hi>Aries, Taurus, the two Images,</hi> which are <hi>Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Spica,</hi> that is, <hi>Virgo Spicifera, Libra,</hi> that is, <hi>a Ballance, Scorpia, the great Image,</hi> that is, <hi>Sagittary, Capricorn, Aquarius, Piſces;</hi> and we ſay, that the Seven proceed from Eaſt to Weſt, and Twelve from Weſt to Eaſt, with the Body of Heaven, which turns as the Circumference of a Wheel round about the Earth, and the Earth being fixed as the Center of Heaven, as a Ball blown up, and a Grain of Millet in the midſt of it: And they attribute the days of the VVeek to theſe ſeven Planets; the firſt day of the VVeek to the <hi>Sun,</hi> the ſecond to the <hi>Moon,</hi> the third to <hi>Mars,</hi> the fourth to <hi>Mercury,</hi> the fifth to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37030:36"/>to <hi>Aphrodite,</hi> that is, <hi>Venus,</hi> the Sabath to <hi>Saturn.</hi> And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the Aſtrologers denote the Parts of Man alſo by the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, to the <hi>Sun</hi> is attributed the Brain, to the <hi>Moon</hi> the Skin, to <hi>Mars</hi> the Blood, to <hi>Mercury</hi> the Nerves and Veins, to <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> the Bones, to <hi>Venus</hi> the Fleſh, to <hi>Saturn</hi> the Hair; and as to the Twelve Signs, they ſay, That they are Types of the Twelve Months, and ſome of them are Males, and ſome of them Females, and every one of them diſpoſe one of the parts of Man, according to the VVill of God.</p>
               <p>Aries diſpoſeth the Head, the Heifer the Neck, the two Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Hands, Cancer the breaſt, Libra the ſide, Virgo the Loyns and back, Leo the Belly, Scorpio the Teſticles, the great Image the Leg, Aquarius the Thighs, Capricorn the Knees, Piſces the Feet: Theſe things we have Tranſcribed here from the Error of the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> to the end that none of them who are furniſhed with Reaſon, may be led Captive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Errors, or rely on their Stories.</p>
               <p>Julian the Heathen ſaith, That this Hiſtory of the Star is not true, becauſe Aſtronomers have not ſpoken thereof; in contradiction to whom we Anſwer, Behold the Stars have ſometimes appeared upon great occaſions, as thoſe which are called Lances, Beames, Comets, therefore it was not beſide order, that by the good pleaſure of God, an unuſual Star ſhould ariſe at the Nativity of our Saviour, and ſhould be the Herauld, when perhaps one of the Angels was Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and appeared to the Wiſe-Men only, and when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, was ſeen; as the Pillar of the Cloud was to Iſrael, ſo was the Star to the Wiſe-Men.</p>
               <p>Again, they ſaid his Star, and not the Star, for as much as his Star did imply, with a Star, the perſon whoſe it was, for a Star is of naked Signification, and the Wiſe Men came to Chriſt, that they might ſee him, and Adore him as God and offer Gifts unto him as to a King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Herod the King heard; and was troubled;</hi> becauſe he was of a ſtrange Nation, and received from Auguſtus the Kingdom of the Jews Unjuſtly; he was greatly troubled, and moved when he heard the report of the Birth of a King, for,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:37030:37"/>he hoped that he had Power in the Land, and was afraid leaſt they might put him to Death, and take his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Moreover, he was troubled for the multitude of the Wiſe-Men, and the Majeſty of their Perſons, and for that in the Metropolis, to Wit, in the Mother of Cities, they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a King, and did not inquire meerly after a King, but after the King of the Jews.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And all Jeruſalem with him.</hi> Why was ſhe troubled at the coming of a Saviour? becauſe ſhe was unwilling to be ſaved, ſhe turned her face from a Redeemer. By the Name of Jeruſalem, he ſignifies the Inhabitants thereof, for they were troubled, yet ſuch was their Sottiſhneſs, that they did not ſo much enquire after their Redeemer, as after the Wiſe-Men; it was troubled alſo, as when he entered thereinto upon an Aſs, and that was, becauſe it envied him, but as yet they ſhewed not their Envy, for they produced Teſtimonies in his behalf, as this, That he was to be born in Bethlehem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he Aſſembled all the Chief Prieſts, and the Scribes of the People,</hi> that is, he Aſſembled them all, and not a part, that he might not fail as to the place where he was born.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he asked of them where Chriſt was to be Born.</hi> The Wiſe-Men Asked concerning a King, and Herod with the Prieſts concerning Chriſt; from the Queſtions of the Wiſe-Men made to the Chief Prieſts, he Learned this, or from this, that he had heard from thoſe who read the Prophets, that Chriſt was to Ariſe, and when he ſaw the Wiſe Men, he underſtood that he was a King; and becauſe Herod, and his Councellours were troubled, he did not accuſe the Wiſe Men, nor did he ſay unto them, how is it that ye proclaim another King beſides me? And if he be born to the Jews, what are ye concerned in the diſcovery of him? And if ye ſay true, ſhew me his Star. But he diſſembled, that he might take him by a Wile.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they ſaid in Bethlehem Judah;</hi> for they did not conteſt againſt the Interrogatory, for they expected the coming of Chriſt, and they Revealed him opportunely, and alleadged the Teſtimony of Micah in that behalf.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, That they made the diſcovery out of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, that he might put him to death; and it is manifeſt from
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37030:37"/>hence, that they did not make the Diſcovery concerning the King of the Edomits, and others, but concerning the King of the Jews.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, they being not as yet filled with Envy, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal him becauſe they were well pleaſed his Nativity ſhould be heard of. Others, becauſe they were at laſt to reveal him; according to that, From whence Chriſt cometh we know not; and ſo they revealed unto them; and from the Number of Weeks which the Scribes computed; and from this, The Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah; and for that Herod governed as a King, when the Scepter departed they knew that the time of his birth was come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alſo thou Bethlehem of Judah art not.</hi> That is, in him thou art magnified, and honoured, and the Nations come from the Ends of the Earth to ſee the Manger, and the Cave wherein he was born</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For he ſhall feed my People Iſrael.</hi> Thoſe he calls ſo who beleive, whether Jews or Gentiles, according to Pauls interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Not all thoſe who are of Iſrael are Iſrael; therefore he calls the Gentiles Iſrael, but did not ſo declare concerning them at the begining, that the Jews might not be offended; and if he were to ariſe from Bethlehem, wherefore was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in Nazareth, and did the Jews forget?</p>
               <p>We ſay that he did not conceal, but reveal the Prophecy, for in Nazareth he was conceived, and at the time of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, his Mother went up to Bethlehem, and he was there for the ſpace of Forty days, and Simeon and Hannah proclaimed him in the Temple; and when the Jews took no notice of him, he was hidden in the mean time, and after two Years the Star publiſhed him, and the wiſe-men adored him, and leſt the Jews might have ſaid that they knew not when he was born, he drew the wiſe Men.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Prophet did not ſay that he was to dwell or converſe in Bethlehem, but to come out thereof, that is, born there; for there he was born, and dwelt in Nazareth, for that he was firſt to come thence, the Jews did not ſay, for they did not know the ſence thereof, or it was no neceſſary anſwer to Herods queſtion, or they were willing to pleaſe Herod in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37030:38"/>omitting it. For the Jews took theſe words, <hi>Of thee ſhall come forth a Shepherd,</hi> to be ſpoken of Zerubabel; but we ſay that their Prieſts did expound this paſſage of Chriſt, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth of Zerubabel was not from the beginning; neither was he born in Bethlehem, but in Babylon, and there he was conceived and born, as ſaid my Lord John, for they who are ſkilled in the Aramaian Tongue, that is the Syriack, know that the name of Zarubabel, is compounded of Seed and Babel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then Herod privily called the Wiſe-men, and learned from them at what time the Star appeared unto them</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He being inquiſitive to learn where he was born, he privily called together the Chief Prieſts, that it ſhould not eſcape his knowledg; and being deſirous to learn concerning the Star, he uſed privacy: Firſt becauſe he was aſhamed of his kindred, leaſt the Wiſe-men might learn who, or whoſe Son he was of the Jews.</p>
               <p>Secondly that the Jews might not perceive that his inquiry after him proceeded from Hatred, for he thought that the Jews had a regard for the Child.</p>
               <p>Thirdly that his parents might not perceive, and fly away with him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That the Craft which he deſigned might not be diſcovered, he enquired of the time of the Star, and not of his Nativity, out of Craft. For he thought with himſelf, If I ſhall ask when he was born, the Jews will apprehend that I ſeek to ſlay him, and they will go and hide him; but I will ask con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the time of the Star, as to the time of the year or month, and accordingly put to death the Children of Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him. But Fool as he was, he underſtood not that his power could not reach his deſign; from hence that the Star proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and the Perſians came to worſhip him, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies were concerning him; and if it were true, it could not be ſalſifyed; and if falſe, why ſhould he be troubled, or be afraid? But it is the nature of Envy ſo to blind the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as not to diſcern Reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Go enquire concerning the Lad:</hi> His Envy would not let him call him King, but Lad; for he could not endure to attribute unto him any Name of Power.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:37030:38"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Show me, that I may alſo go and Worſhip him.</hi> He deſigned to deceive, and Cozen the Jews in promiſing to Worſhip him.</p>
               <p>And moreover, That the Wiſe-Men might return unto him, to the End, that without any Man's taking notice, he might Murther the Lord, and that without fear he might poſſeſs himſelf of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And ſome ſay, That Herod gave a Viaticum to the Wiſe-Men, and promiſed them ſome Reward at their Return, but the Wiſe-Men did not ſuſpect, that Herod intended Evil un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And behold the Star which they ſaw in the Eaſt went before them:</hi> When they came to Hieruſalem it diſappeared, that the Jews might not enquire after him, nor Learn the Prophecy, and perceive; but now it began to Conduct them. None of the Jews went out with them to Conduct them, becauſe they hated him; but this ſeems not to be true; for many went out to ſee what was Worthy of Admiration, although they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, but Providence forbad them, for if any Man ſhould have Conducted them, it had been ſuperfluous for the Star to have appeared, and there had been no uſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Beſides, none was to place a Favour on the Wiſe-Men for coducting them, for he who began would finiſh; and the Jews were not to conduct the Gentiles, as ſaith the Scripture, <hi>He is the hope of the Gentiles;</hi> for this Star went before them from North to South; for, ſuch is the poſture of Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem from Hieruſalem; and hence it is known, that it was no natural Star.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill it came, and ſtood over the place where the Child was.</hi> That is to ſay, the Star deſcended until it ſtood over the Child, and pointed at him as with a Finger, for he was not in a Houſe of great Note, and becauſe he was to Worſhip the Lord of the Houſe, therefore he approached near to the top of the Houſe, according to that, <hi>Praiſe him ye Stars, and Light, and ye Creatures that are nigh praiſe him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And when they ſaw the Star, they rejoyced with great glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> That is to ſay, that their Labour was not in vain, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:37030:39"/>that their hopes did not deceive them. But what became of the Star after it ſhewed the Child?</p>
               <p>Some ſay, That it went to a Field near Bethlehem, which was called the Star, and which Anciently prefigured this Star; for, if Bethlehem, which is interpreted, <hi>an Houſe of Bread,</hi> did Typifie the Bread of Life which came down from Heaven, which was the Word, <hi>who was Incarnated;</hi> it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that alſo a Village called <hi>Cocheba,</hi> or a Star, might have prefigured the Star which Conducted the Wiſe-Men. But we ſay, That it was an Angel that Aſſumed a Similitude, who after he had performed his Miniſtry, Aſcended into Heaven, and Ranged himſelf in his Order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they went into the Houſe, and ſaw the Lord with his Mother.</hi> It's ſaid, They went into the Houſe, and not into the Cave, and that they ſaw the <hi>Lad,</hi> and not a Child newly born, and put in a Manger; from whence it is evident, that the Wiſe-Men ſaw Chriſt when he was two years of Age, nor were they Scandalized when they ſaw the Lad without Glory, like to his Star, by reaſon of the Greatneſs of their Faith, and the Teſtimony of the Chief Prieſts, and the Prophecies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, which they heard from the Scribes, and the Tumult, and Commotion of Jeruſalem, and therefore they were not offended when they ſaw him in an Empty and Low Condition.</p>

                  <hi>And they fell down, and Worſhipped him.</hi> His Divinity ſhone upon them, and this it was that made them Worſhip him, as alſo the Aſpect of the Star which Conducted them, did perſwade to Worſhip him; they Adored him out of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and not by conſtraint, for the ſight begat Admiration in them, and Knowledg Joy.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Coming of the Wiſe-Men, David Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, <hi>The Kings of Sheba, and Seba ſhall bring Gifts unto him, and Jacob, the Nations ſhall expect him;</hi> here it is apparent, that the Gentiles preceded the Jews in Worſhiping him; and how was it, that he did not at firſt ſay, <hi>Go, and Teach all Nations,</hi> but at laſt? Becauſe it behoved, That the Types ſhould go firſt, for it was fit, that the Jews ſhould offer firſt.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:37030:39"/>But foraſmuch as they would not, but rejected help, the Word turned himſelf unto the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they opened their Sumptures:</hi> That is to ſay, their Gifts were fixed, and under Seal, according to the Cuſtom of Kings, who ſending Gifts to other Kings, ſeal them up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they offered unto him Gifts, Gold, Myrrh, and Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe:</hi> That is, according to their Cuſtom they offered theſe Gifts; for they were accuſtomed to burn Incenſe to their Gods, and to give Gold to their Kings, and to embalm their Dead with Myrrh: And foraſmuch as they underſtood that he was God, and a King, and that he was to Dye, and to be Anointed, they offered unto him theſe Gifts; Frankincenſe, in relation to his Divinity; Gold, in relation to the Majeſty of a King; and Myrrh, to his Death, the cauſe of Life.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Gold denotes that Worſhip which is preferred before Gold, is returned to its Lord: Myrrh and Incenſe ſignify that he is the Phyſician who binds up the Fracture of Adam.</p>
               <p>Again, It is ſaid, <hi>That to him every knee ſhall bow, of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and of Earth, and under the Earth;</hi> theſe Gifts were a Myſtery of the Trinity, which from Divine Revelation was made known unto us; by Gold, the Worſhip of Coeleſtial Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he ſignifies that he was heavenly; by Frankincenſe, which is Terreſtrial, that he is King of Earthly Concerns; by Myrrh, in the third place under the Earth, that he is Lord of his own, and the Cauſer of them.</p>
               <p>Again, By Gold they ſignifie the Purity and invincible nature of Faith; by Frankincenſe the truth of Hope in him, for he helps and comforts the Souls which believe in him: By Myrrh they parabolize Love, which is the Bond of Faith, which bind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and knits together the Members of the Church, as is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of Myrrh.</p>
               <p>Again, In as much as Gold is the King of all inſenſible things, it is juſtly offered to the King of ſenſible and inſenſible things; and as Gold onely of Earthly Conſtitutions doth not contract ruſt, and is only of that Soluble and Combuſtible Subſtance which is not diminiſhed by the heat of fine, ſo alſo the Kingdome of Jeſus is not to be diminiſhed, or to periſh, as it is written.</p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:37030:40"/>
               <p>Again, By Gold they ſignified the purity of his fleſh, for he committed no wickedneſs, nor was he guilty of deceit. By Myrrh they notifyed his paſſion, for his body was perfumed with an hundred weight of Myrrh. David ſaith, That thy Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are perfumed with Myrrh, Caſſia, and Storax; by Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe they thought that we were to be, through Chriſt, a ſweet ſavour unto God, among thoſe who are to be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Again, By Gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they offered as it were the Chief of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſitive things; by Frankincenſe, all Trees, whereby alſo is ſignified the ſweetneſs which we receive from our Lord; by Myrrh all Perfumes. Moreover he hints the approbation &amp; dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of his Commands, according to that, how narrow is the gate, and ſtreight the way. But from whence did the Wiſe-Men learn that they were to bring gifts? Some ſay that they were treaſured up by Adam in a Cave; and that he commanded Seth, that by tradition they ſhould be delivered from one to another in ſucceſſion, ſo that the Wiſe-men at the coming of Chriſt might come &amp; offer them; but this declaration is not approved of by underſtanding Men.</p>
               <p>Others ſay that they learned this from Divine Revelation. Others, That they knew from the Star which appeared unto them, that he who was born was God, and King, and that he was to dye; <hi>they went and offered unto him Gold, Myrrh and Frankincenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here Julian objects, Since that Frankincenſe was offered to Chriſt, wherefore do ye not burn Frankincenſe in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but more precious Aromaticks.</p>
               <p>We anſwer, That they did not offer Frankincenſe unto Chriſt at his own requeſt, but of their own diſcretion offered it according to their cuſtome, and he accepted of it, not as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the gift, but the intention of the giver, for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed them with a pure conſcience; but we burn ſweeter Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks in the Temples, that the Faithfull may be perfumed with a ſweet odour when they enter into them. But what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of the offerings? We anſwer, That Joſeph and Mary took them, and brought them with them to Egypt, for they were not ſo great, nor ſo many, but that they could carry them; nor were they offered for the abundance of them, but they offered
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:37030:40"/>them for the myſtery and ſignificancy of them, as firſt fruits; for God doth not reſpect the abundance, as one that is indigent, but the intention of the givers; as in the caſe of the widdows Mites.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it was ſhewed unto them in a Dream, that they ſhould not return to Herod,</hi> and they were not offended, nor did they ſay to the Angel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherefore are we to fly away? But gave Obedience to Divine Intimation, for Faith doth not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute when it is commanded. And what appeared to them in a Dream? Some ſay, That Herod appeared unto them, bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhing his Sword, and approaching to the Lad to kill him. Saint John ſaith, That an Angel appeared in a Dream and ſaid unto them, <hi>Do not return to Herod.</hi> And moreover, that he conducted them, and Tranſported them to their place by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way. And wherefore were they prohibited to return to Herod? Some ſay, That they ſhould not know the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Herod, who deſigned to kill the Lad; others ſay, That Joſeph and Mary might have opportunity to fly, for, had they returned unto him, he had immediately ſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cauſed the Lad to be put to Death, and they would not have an opportunity of Eſcape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they went another way to their Country.</hi> This was Ordained by Divine Providence, that they might Preach to other Nations who did not underſtand, for the Nations who did not underſtand at their coming up to them, they Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at their going away, for, if they did Preach in other Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, and openly to Herod, how much father in their own Countries?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſe, lead away the Lad, and his Mother, and fly unto E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> He did not ſay Lead away the Lad, and thy Wife, but the Lad and his Mother; to ſhew, that he lived holily with her, even after ſhe brought forth, and to teach him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it was not lawful to come near unto her, for when ſhe Concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he called her his Wife, for he knew he could not come near her, by reaſon the Holy-Ghoſt poſſeſſed her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that to free her from ſuſpicion of Adultery; for, if ſhe had been guilty of Adultery, he had not called her his Wife; here he ſhewed the Faith of Joſeph, that it was not leſs than that of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37030:41"/>the Wiſe-Men. Sometime he ſaid unto him, that he would ſave his people from their Sins; and now, Fly into Egypt; for, he did not object to the Angel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How ſayd'ſt thou, that he will ſave his people, and now ſayeſt, fly away with him; and he who ſaves not himſelf, how can he ſave others? But ſuch was the abundance of his Faith, that he did not make ſuch Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the Angel.</p>
               <p>But the Heathens object thus, That he who fled from He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod, is not God, but feeble.</p>
               <p>We Anſwer, That he did not Fly from Herod, and if he would have fled, it had been better to have fled with the Wiſe-Men, or to have been hidden in that Country; as many times they laid their hands on him, and he paſſed thorough them and went his way; for, he it was who put a Legion to Flight, and did drive out Devils, and Diſeaſes, and ſtilled the Sea. How did he fly, who preſerved Moſes in an Ark, and ſtruck them with Blindneſs, who followed Eliſha, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red David from Saul, and preſerved Jeremie, and Baruch in Jeruſalem, and ſtruck the Sodomites with dimneſs of Sight; how did he fly away? Wherefore he did not Fly of Weakneſs, but by Gods Ordinance he took upon him humane Exinanition; and as he ſaid, <hi>I repent that I have made Man, and that I have made Saul a King,</hi> though he did not at all Repent; and ſaid to the Congregation, <hi>I have Eſpouſed thee to my ſelf in Righteouſneſs,</hi> though God doth not Eſpouſe; ſo the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith, <hi>He fled;</hi> though he did not fly as God, nor did he change from place to place, but fled as he was Man, by reaſon of Divine Ordinance; and for theſe Cauſes:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, That that might be done in Egypt which was done in Perſia at the coming of the Wiſe Men, for when he came into Egypt, he ſubverted all the Idols that were there, and they fell; to thoſe two Nations who moſt abounded in Error, he firſt tendered his Doctrine; to Perſia, by a Star; to Egypt, by going thither in his own Perſon.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, That he might fulfil that Prophecy, <hi>Out of Egypt have I called my Son;</hi> and, <hi>Behold the Lord rode upon a thin Cloud, and came into Egypt.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:37030:41"/>
                  <item>Thirdly, That he might Illuſtrate by Example that ſaying, <hi>When they Perſecute you in this City, Fly unto another, and do not reſiſt Evil.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Fourthly, That he might not prejudice the free-will of Herod, and calumniate his prime Creature; and that the Fame of his Birth might be ſpread among all Men, by the trouble of Herod, and the Slaughter of Children, whilſt Men asking the Cauſe thereof, they might learn, that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt was born. And that this Diſpenſation might be admired, for if from the ſwadling cloaths temptations attended him, let us not be offended if they befall us; He Sent away the Wiſe-men ſpeedily, that they might teach other Countreys and Perſia.</item>
                  <item>And laſtly that he might lenify the fooliſh inſanitie of Herod, and teach us not to oppoſe things too ſtrong for our reſiſtance.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Again, if he had not fled, one of theſe two had happned, he muſt either have been killed, or not killed. And if he had been killed it had been abſurd, for his diſpenſation had not yet been fully adminiſtred; according to that, <hi>My hour is not yet come.</hi> And if he had turned the edg of the ſword, and had not been ſlain, it would not have been believed that he was cloathed with a Body; for if when he Exerted many humane operations, Men preſumed to ſay that he was not cloathed with a Body, what would they not have objected if he had performed all his Actions agreeably to the Power of his Divinity? And if any one ſhall ſay, that the Martyrs blunted the Edges of Swords, and the three Youths extinguiſh'd the Fite, really and not apparently. We Anſwer, That theſe things they did after they had teſtified that they were Men, and their Victory is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Divine Power; <hi>for the Word was God;</hi> and after he had teſtified that he was made Man, he wrought Miracles, but he did not work Miracles immediately after his Nativity, that he might not be thought a Phantaſme, and therefore he fled into Egypt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And be there until I ſhall tell thee.</hi> He doth not appoint the time of his Flight within any limited term, but without limitation, as did Elia to Shemaia; ſaying, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil I ſhall tell,</hi> to ſhew that all things which he did, mov'd from Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:37030:42"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>For Herod will ſeek after the Lad to deſtroy him:</hi> That is, and not to Worſhip him, as he politickly gave out, but to Slay him; yet Joſeph is not hereat offended, but remembring the Revelation of the Angel, and the coming of the Wiſe-Men, beſides other things, he receiv'd the Command in Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Joſeph took the Lad, and his Mother, and Fled into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> And ſome ſay, That they fled that Night deſtitute of all things, having not ſo much as hired an Aſs, becauſe that was reſerv'd for Entrance into Jeruſalem. Others ſay, That they had nothing, except the Offerings of the Wiſe-Men, and the Carpenters Tools of Joſeph. But Mary, when ſhe heard this, ſhe took up the Lad on her Shoulders, and went her way on foot, and charged Joſeph to hire an Aſs, and to bring what they had, and to come after her. Others ſay, That ſhe came to Egypt with difficulty, becauſe the Deſtruction of the Children who were ſtrangled by <hi>Pharo</hi> came into her thoughts, and for theſe Cauſes Mary had need of an Eſpous'd Husband to be an Aſſiſtant to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Out of Egypt have I called my Son.</hi> The Jews ſay, That this is ſaid concerning us who were called out of Egypt. And we ſay, That it is the manner of Prophecies, that when they pronounce Words concerning certain Men, they are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd in others; for behold, Jacob ſaid to Simeon and Levi, <hi>I will divide them in Jacob, and ſcatter them in Iſrael;</hi> and it did not come to paſs in them, but in their Off-ſpring; and that of Noah concerning Canaan was accompliſh'd in the Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, the Off-ſpring of Canaan. And that of Iſaac to Jacob, <hi>Thou ſhalt be the Chief among thy Brethren:</hi> So here this is fulfilled in Chriſt, and not in Iſrael, and the going down and coming up of the Children of Iſrael from Egypt, was a Type of our Lords going down and coming up from Egypt; And this, That <hi>Iſrael is called the Son of God,</hi> is like that, <hi>My Son, my firſt born Iſrael,</hi> and this Name was by Grace Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them, but they have loſt it by Worſhiping Baal and and Idols, and they are called of John, <hi>a Generation of Vipers,</hi> and our Lord, <hi>the Children of Satan;</hi> but Mathew, when he ſaw our Lord went into, and came out of Egypt, he ſaid, <hi>Now
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:37030:42"/>is fulfilled this, that I have called my Son,</hi> and not in the time of Iſrael. The Angel did not ſay, <hi>I will go down into Egypt with ye, and come up with ye,</hi> for the Power of the Lad is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for all theſe things; for he was God who was made Fleſh, without being changed, and having been the Creator of Times, is ſubjected to the Stature of Time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herod when he ſaw that he was deluded by the Wiſe-men;</hi> that is, inaſmuch as they did not come and make diſcovery concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Lad, but contemned him, he did not believe that his Fraud was known.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He was very angry;</hi> That is, againſt the Wiſe men, pouring forth his rage againſt the Wiſe men on the ſimple Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſent and ſlew all the Children of Bethlem and all the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thereof from two Years old and under, according to the time he had inquired.</hi> For he ſlew the Children that with them he might murder Chriſt, and becauſe he did not know him, he ſlew all their Children, and ſlew alſo the Children in the Borders thereof, becauſe it was ſuſpected they might have made him fly into one of the bordering Villages, and that he might not eſcape death. And in ſaying <hi>All,</hi> he ſhew'd that there was not one omitted. He ſaid, <hi>From two years old and under,</hi> becauſe he enquiring of the Wiſe-men, they anſwered him, <hi>It was two years ſince the Star appeared unto us;</hi> therefore ſaid the Lord E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim and Euſebius, that the Wiſe men came in the ſecond year of our Lords Nativity. And the Lord John and St. Cyrill ſay that the Star appeared two years before, and that the Wiſe men tarried long before they came in the way, and when they came, our Redeemer was born, and worſhiped in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and in Swadling-Cloaths.</p>
               <p>But whether theſe or they be in the right, the Diſcourſe of the Evangeliſt is certainly true, which ſaith, <hi>According to the time he had enquir'd:</hi> Some they killed waking, ſome ſleeping, ſome having hold of the Breſt, ſome ſwimming; others they ſnatch'd from their Mothers Embraces, and waſh'd with their blood their Mothers and the Earth, and there was great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and weeping becauſe there was not an houſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Boy had not been murdered and from the conteſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of ſome, ſaying the Lad is two years old, and of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:37030:43"/>ſaying he is not; and of ſome ſaying there is a Child here, and of others ſaying to the contrary, and the like, there was a great clamor and Lamentation.</p>
               <p>Some men demand, <hi>How many Children were ſlain?</hi> And this is not known; but ſome buſie-bodies babble, ſaying, That He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod ſent forty Head-Officers, and with every of them forty Butchers or Man-ſlayers, and every of theſe Butchers killed forty Children: Wherefore there being forty Officers, and the Butchers with them being 1600, the Children who were ſlain muſt be 64000. This we have not writ as believing it to be true, but for delight of the ſimple.</p>
               <p>Wherefore did our Lord withdraw, the Killing of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and was our Lord or Herod the cauſe of the Killing of them?</p>
               <p>We anſwer, That Chriſt was not the cauſe of their being ſlain, no more than David was the cauſe of killing the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Prieſts whom Saul ſlew; but as Saul himſelf was the cauſe of killing the Prieſts, ſo Herod was the cauſe of ſlaying the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants: And as Elia was not the cauſe of burning the two Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Fifties, and thoſe who were with them, but thoſe who ſent them: But we ſay, As Peter was the cauſe of killing the Soldiers, ſo Chriſt was the cauſe of killing the Children.</p>
               <p>Moreover, The execrable wickedneſs of the King was the cauſe of their deſtruction; for had Herod ſeen the Walls bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the Doors pulled open, he might have put the Soldiers to death; but all things being ſure, he ought to have worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Doer of Miracles, and not to have ſlain the Keepers; for God was willing to have converted the King, and not that the Guards ſhould have committed deſtruction. So here the coming of the Wiſe-men, the aſſembling of the Scribes, the Teſtimony of Prophecy, were, that Herod might believe, and be ſaved, and not that he ſhould kill the Children. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did God permitt them to be ſlain? Some ſay, That the, Fame of his Nativity might be made known in every place; others, that the Prophecy might be fulfilled, according to that, <hi>a voice was heard in Rama.</hi> But theſe are not approv'd expoſitions. We ſay therefore that this permiſſion was given that they might not be as their parents, nor partake of Innocent blood. 2ly That
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37030:43"/>they might receive an Earneſt of the Kingdom long ſince prepared for them, as an Inheritance, and might at his ſecond coming enter into poſſeſſion thereof.</p>
               <p>Again, All our Sufferings are of two kinds, either for our Sins, or that a Reward might be given to us for the ſame; and 'tis evident from what Paul ſaid of him who committed Fornication; <hi>Deliver him to Satan in the Body, that he may live by the Spirit, in the day of our Lord.</hi> And David when he overcame Shimei, commanded he ſhould not be put to Death, and he ſaid, <hi>Behold my Subjection and Labour, and forgive me all my Iniquity;</hi> they therefore are not miſerable who ſuffer Evil, if they patiently ſuffer, whether they be corrected of God, or Perſecuted by Satan for their Sin; and for Sufferings of the ſecond kind, to wit, for Wages, or Reward, that of Job may ſuffice for Illuſtration; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Children ſuffer'd in the ſecond kind, in relation to Wages or Reward. And what Sin was it that was Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Children? For behold they ſinned not. We An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it was ſufficient for them that they were to be Reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Bliſs after Death; he did not impugn the Free-Will of Herod; for Free-Will is a great Gift, given unto Men for the doing what they will, and God does not Reverſe his Gift, and if they periſh'd, they obtain'd great Trophies of Victory; and we ſay, that if God had known that they would have proved Virtuous, he had not permitted that they ſhould dye; for if he forbears the Wicked, how much leſs would he have permitted them to have been overcome; but they went away being Innocent, and eſcaped Evil, and became Martyrs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they bore Teſtimony for Chriſt, and the Baptiſm of Blood ſupplyed the Place of Water-Baptiſm. But how were they Martyrs, being ſlain without knowledg? We Anſwer, that in this kind or manner, Children receive the Gift of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm without Knowledg, and it is a true Gift unto them, and ſo Slaughter was true Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rachel Weeping for her Children.</hi> Jeremy ſaid this, perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the Jews led Captive to Babylon, and by Rachel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umbrated the Tribes of Benjamin and Judah. Mathew makes uſe of this Text in reference to the Murther of the Children.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37030:44"/>Others (with whom we alſo agree) ſay, That Jeremy hereby Typified the Children, and 'tis evident from the ſubſequent Words, which run thus: <hi>Reſtrain thy Voice from Weeping, for there is a Reward for thy Tears,</hi> for they who were led Captive to Babylon, had no Reward for their Tears, for they were led into Captivity for their Sins; but the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being put to Death in their Infancy, there was a Reward reſerv'd for them; it is therefore evident that Jeremy ſpoke in Relation to them; and Rama belonged to the Children of Benjamin, and Bethlehem of Judah alſo belonged unto them; and becauſe Rama was the Capital City of the Tribe of Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, therefore it was reputed alſo the City of his Mother.</p>
               <p>But, Since Rachel dyed ſo long before, wherefore are the Children imputed to her? We Anſwer, becauſe it is agreeable to the Law of Nature, and to the Scripture; accordingly all the Children of Men are called the Children of Adam, and the Iſraelites are called the Children of Iſrael; and becauſe the Children were of Rama, therefore they are computed the Children of Rachel. But ſithence, the Children were ſlain in Bethlehem, as well as in Rama; Wherefore doth he apply the Weeping to Rama only? Some ſay, becauſe the Prophet foreſaw, that more Children were ſlain in Rama than in Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem; therefore he uſeth the Names of Rachel and Rama. Others ſay, becauſe Rama is nigh unto Bethlehem, therefore he applied Weeping unto Rachel, and her Children are called of Rama, becauſe it was as the Inheritance of Benjamin her Son, and of Bethlehem, by reaſon of the Vicinity of her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher thereunto.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, That as there were two Men who came before the Judg, and the one was guilty of Death, and the other not, and as he who was guilty was ſilent, and he who was Innocent cryed out and pleaded for himſelf; ſo he was born for, and in reſpect of Ramah, and Bethlehem, but Rachel was not born for them, and therefore he applies Weeping to Rama, becauſe they were not guilty nor injurious.</p>
               <p>Wherefore does he apply Weeping to Rachel and not to Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, ſince they were his Children who were Slain? And ſome ſay, That both of them were the Children of one Husband and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37030:44"/>Wife, and therefore he applies Weeping to Rachel and not to Jacob; to whom one replies, That if they were of both, it had been fit to have applied Weeping to them both. Others, becauſe they were ſlain in their Mothers Arms (their Fathers not being preſent) Weeping is Attributed to the Mother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Again others, becauſe the Love of a Mother is much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant than that of Fathers. Again, Rachel died in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and theſe were ſlain ſoon after they were born. Samuel ſaid unto Saul, behold, <hi>Three Men are to meet thee in Tſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſach near Rachels Sepulcher in the Border of Benjamin.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Rachel was buried a Perſian days Journey from <hi>Ephrata,</hi> which is Bethlehem, and perhaps they who were ſlain, were buried in her Sepulcher.</p>

                  <hi>When Herod the King was Dead:</hi> From this time he receiv'd his Judgment; for Euſebius ſaith, That Joſephus wrote thus concerning him, That he fell into a Devouring Diſeaſe, being Worm-Eaten, and oppreſſed with ſadneſs of Spirit, and that his Lower Parts, to witt, his Teſticles, and prolific Member became putrid, and that in a furious Rapture of his mind, and in his Tribulation, he ſlew his Wife and his three Sons; and when they made him ſit in Oyl, and in a hot Bath, his Eyes were Tranſverſed, and he miſerably forſook the World.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>For they are Dead, who ſought the Soul of the Child.</hi> He ſaith <hi>Soul,</hi> That he might not give Advantage to them, who ſay, That our Saviour did not Aſſume a Soul, but that the Divinity ſupply'd the place of the Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he Aroſe, and took the Lad and his Mother;</hi> That is, according to the command of the Angel, without repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But when he heard that Archelaus Adminiſtred as a King in Judea, in the place of his Father, he was afraid to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> Firſt, Leſt with the Authority of his Father, he might
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37030:45"/>Inherit an Enmity towards the Children. Secondly, He fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Mothers of the Children, leſt they ſeeing the Lad, and calling to mind thereby, that their Children were ſlain for him, might either Murther him, or accuſe him before Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus, and he ſlay him. Neither did Elizabeth return for fear of the Jews, till the end of her Life. But how doth he ſay, That Archelaus Governed in Judea, whereas Pontius Pilate had the Government thereof? We Anſwer, that ſo ſoon after the Death of Herod, the Kingdom was not divided into Provinces; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at his Death, his Son took hold of his Government. He ſaith, <hi>in the place of Herod his Father,</hi> to diſtinguiſh him from another Herod, who was the Brother of Archilaus. Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor the Askalonite begat that Herod who ſlew the Children, and he begat Nine Sons of ſeven Women; that is to ſay, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipater, Alexander, Ariſtobulus, Herod and Archilaus, and Herod the Tetrach, and Herod and Philip, and one that was cut out of his Mothers Womb.</p>
               <p>But how many Herods were there who occaſioned Errour, being of the ſame Name? They ſay, four; Herod the firſt a Prieſt, who belonged to an Idol Temple of Askalon, a City of the Philiſtins; he begat Antipater, whom the Edomites took Captive, and Educated him in their Rites, and Antipater begat Herod the King, who flew the Children; and he begat Herod the Tetrarch and his Brethren; and this Tetrarch (that is one of four) ſlew John, and in his days our Lord ſuffer'd, and the Tetrarch begat that Herod, who is called Agrippa, who was clad in Royal Robes, of whom mention is made in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Jacobus Aurihenſis faith, That there were five Herods; Herod who ſlew the Infants, begat of Duſis the firſt Antipater, who was calle by the Name of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and of Mary the Queen, the Daughter of Arcanus, the King and High-Prieſt, Alexander and Ariſtobulus; theſe their Father ſlew, together with their Mother, being accuſed of Rebellion againſt him; and of the other Mary, the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the High-Prieſt, Arcanus, and Herod and Antipater; and of Cleophta the Hieroſolymitan, Herod and Philip. And of <hi>Phelis, Pheſil;</hi> theſe were the Sons of Herod the Firſt; the Herod who was called Antipater, and was Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:37030:45"/>ſlew John; him Julius Caeſar banniſh'd into <hi>Spain</hi> with his Wife Herodias, where they died miſerably. Herod, who was Brother of Philip, by Father and Mother, was King in Kanſhrin, being betrothed unto Bernice his Fathers Siſter. Herod Agrippa mentioned in the Book of the <hi>Acts</hi> to have died at Caeſara, was not the Son of Herod the Firſt, nor of the great Tetrarch, but the Son of Ariſtobulus who was ſlain, and he was Grandſon to Herod the Firſt. Archelaus was not afraid of the King who was born, as was his Father; either, becauſe he thought he was ſlain with the Children, or becauſe he ſaw his Father died a miſerable Death, he feared the like misfortune might befal him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it was ſhewed him in a Dream, that he ſhould go into the Region of Galilee;</hi> But if he were afraid to go into Judea, by reaſon of Archelaus, he had reaſon to fear going into Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee, becauſe of Herod; but the place being changed, the matter was concealed, for all the fear was about Bethlehem, and the Borders thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the City which was called Nazareth;</hi> That is, he came hither firſt, to avoid Danger, and that he might inhabit in his own Region better, and be confident; and he receiv'd Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the Angel, to make this place his Habitation, that this Prophecy might be fulfilled; <hi>He ſhall be called a Nazarite.</hi> Mathew faith, he came from Bethlehem to Egypt, but Luke to Jeruſalem, and from thence to Nazareth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and both declare the Truth; but this of Luke was firſt, for he abode forty days in Bethlehem, from the time he was born, and afterwards went to Jeruſalem and offer'd Gifts, and Simeon bore him, and from Jeruſalem he went to Nazareth; and at the end of that Anniverſary, he came to Jeruſalem, and ſo returned to Nazareth; and at the end of the ſecond year, he came from Nazareth to Jeruſalem, and from thence to Bethlehem; and there the Wiſe-Men Worſhipped him; and from Bethlehem he went to Egypt, as ſaith Mathew; and Luke declares where he was born, and what things were done at his Nativity, and that he went up to Jeruſalem, when the days of her Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were accompliſh'd; and when they had performed what the Law required, they went unto Nazareth: Mathew afterwards
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37030:46"/>ſets forth, that the Wiſe-men came and found him in Bethlehem after he was Circumciz'd and had offered his Gifts, and was two years old and then it was told Joſeph that he ſhould carry him by flight into Egypt, and he remained three years in Egypt and ſuddenly returned to Nazareth, and hence it is known, that the Wife-men worſhipped him when he was two years old, for there was no Congruity with reaſon or conveniency that they ſhould bring him up to the Temple whileſt Herod breath'd forth deſtruction againſt the Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which is called Nazareth:</hi> The Jews queſtion in what book theſe two paſſages are written, viz. <hi>He ſhall be called a Nazarite,</hi> and, <hi>Out of Egypt have I called my Son:</hi> To whom we ſay, that theſe are not allegations of praiſe and exaltation, but of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, for this word Nazareth they ſpoke of it as an houſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency, <hi>out of Nazareth,</hi> &amp;c. And the other is applyed to flight, and had they not been True, Mathew had not produced them becauſe they were not of advantage. Moreover many books periſhed, as the book of Barjamin teacheth us, for the Jews continually were drawn into the Errour of Idolatry, and ſome of the Books they loſt, and ſome of them they tore, as Jeremia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, and he who wrote the Book of the Kings faith, that Deuteronomie was ſcarce found after a long time, which was hidden and plundered. For if when they were free from Warr, they had ſo little care or regard for Books, much leſs had they in the time of war; And if they ſhall ſay, if it was not written in the time of Chriſt, whence doth Matthew produce it? We anſwer, that it was the daughter of a Voice.</p>
               <p>And in the time of Mathew it was delivered and propagated from mouth to mouth, and therefore Mathew wrote it, or it was in the Books which were Loſt, or the Spirit which dwelt upon him in the Parlour Revealed it unto him, or in his time, it was preſerv'd in Books and after Mathew wrote it, periſh'd in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the City by the Romans. And if a Jew will indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to Falcify the Goſpel becauſe this allegation is not Extant, he may be Reprehended from his own Books wherein are many Speeches written ſay'd to be in writing, and are not written; wherefore we may hold theirs in the like repute.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ANd in thoſe days came John the Baptiſh:</hi> He doth not underſtand by <hi>thoſe days,</hi> the time when Jeſus returned from Egypt to Nazareth, for in thoſe days Jeſus was five years old; but the time of his abode in Nazareth being Twenty five Years, he was Thirty Years of Age when he came to Baptiſm, as ſaith Luke. Others are of opinion that he calls <hi>thoſe days,</hi> the time when he came to be baptized; for it is the cuſtom of Scripture to term by the Name of <hi>thoſe days,</hi> the days wherein any matter, what-e'er it be, is acted or done. Others think that he calls <hi>thoſe days,</hi> the time wherein the Jews had neither King nor Prophet; foraſmuch as the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Jacob was fulfilled, <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart,</hi> &amp;c. but Tiberius then Reigned, as Luke ſaith.</p>
               <p>Others ſay thus, <hi>In thoſe days,</hi> that is, our Lord did not (immediately) after his teturn from Egypt come to John, but when he was Thirty Years of Age, being Two years old when he went down into Egypt, where he remained Three years; and afterwards dwelt in Nazareth Twenty five Years, and in theſe years he paid the debt of our Nature, and fulfilled the Law, and abrogated it; and it is the Cuſtom of Scripture not only to compute a long time by days, according to that, <hi>In the days of Amraphel,</hi> and, <hi>In the days of Hoſiah,</hi> but alſo by a day, as thus, <hi>The whole day of Warfare afflicted me;</hi> and, <hi>The whole day of my ſhame is before me,</hi> ſpeaking of an extended duration of time.</p>
               <p>Others are of opinion that Mathew ſpoke not theſe things as immediately referring to the time wherein the things above ſpoken of relates, for John did not ſuddenly begin to baptize when he returned from Egypt. But when our Lord was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized he was Thirty Years of Age. So that Mathew intended
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:37030:48"/>to ſay that at a certain time that John came: So when he ſaith, then came Jeſus or then was Jeſus led to the Wilderneſs, he doth not ſpeak in the ſeries of time relating to what immediately was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of, for it is the Cuſtom of Scripture to ſpeak thus, for though when he ſat in the mount of Olives, and ſpake of the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, and the Finiſhing of that Generation, he ſubjoyns a Declaration concerning the End of the World, which were farr diſtant the one from the other: So here he includes the whole time of his infancy, and that of his abode in Nazraeth, and alſo the Thirtieth year (of his Age) with one of thoſe times that John came. Auguſtus reigned fifty Six years, and in the forty firſt year of his Reign Chriſt was born, and his Son Tiberius took upon him the Kingdom and in the fifteenth year of his Reign came John the Baptiſt; ſo that the years from the Taxing which was in the days of Auguſtus when our Redeemer was born, to the fifteenth of Tiberius being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, make up thirty years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Came John the Baptiſt:</hi> That is to ſay, from the Ziphian Wilderneſs to the Region of Judea; he calls him the Baptiſt, becauſe God ſent him to Baptize with the Baptiſm of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: Mathew doth not definitely declare thoſe days, but Luke ſpeaks definitely.</p>
               <p>It behoves here to make inquiry of many things; from whence therefore came John? We Anſwer, from the Ziphian Wilderneſs where he was brought up; for at the time the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were ſlain; foraſmuch as the Wiſe-Men returned not unto Herod, he began again in Rage to enquire of the Prieſts, where Chriſt was born, and one of thoſe who ſtood by, ſaid unto him, There is born in our Neighbourhood a Boy the Son of a Prieſt, and it is given out, that he is the Meſſiah; and he ſent immediately to make purſuit after him, and when Zachary came, he demanded of him, ſaying, <hi>Where is thy Son,</hi> and Zachary Anſwer'd, <hi>He is in the Houſe,</hi> and he ſent Souldiers with him to fetch him, but one of the Standers by, made haſte, and gave notice thereof to Elizabeth, &amp; ſhe took him up, and departed in haſte, and went to the Ziphian Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Zachary then coming to the Houſe, and finding, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Elizabeth nor John, he was afraid to return, and went
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:37030:48"/>his way, and took Sanctuary at the Altar; but Herod ſent thither, and cauſed him to be ſlain.</p>
               <p>The Lord Ephraim ſaith, That ſhe received Direction by Viſion, to fly from the Sword of Herod, and that ſhe made him a Coat of Gamels Hair, and a Girdle to bind his Loyns; and that they grew together with him, thirty years, as the Garments of the Children of Iſrael increaſed with them forty years. John was two years and a half Old when he fled; Others ſaid, That an Angel ſnatched him from his Mothers Arms, and that neither his Mother nor Father knew the Place of his Abode.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, That when his Father perceived the Sword of Herod drawn againſt him, he carried him up to the Temple, where his Conception was Denounced, and betook himſelf to his Prayers, and that he was thence Tranſlated to the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which when the Jews apprehended, they asked him, Where is the Lad? And he Anſwer'd, <hi>I know not,</hi> but they ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt deſtroyed thp Son out of Envy to our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> he then betook him to the Altar for Refuge; but ſuch was their Accurſed Prophaneſs, that they flew him there: Others ſay, That the Jews ſlew Zachary out of Spleen and Envy, becauſe he did not deprive the Virgin of her place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Virgins; but we agree with thoſe, who ſay, That Herod ſlew him; yet this Blood remained, Crying with a fervent Voice fifty eight years, until Titus the Son of Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian coming againſt the City and ſubduing it, entred into the Temple, and ſaw the reeking Blood; and there hearing the Cry, enquired, and found this to be the Cauſe; and then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place gave his Command, and accordingly the Prieſts were Slain; and at this time ceaſed the Cry, and Reeking of the Blood.</p>
               <p>John as they ſay, until he Arrived at fifteen years of Age, ſucked of his Mothers Milk in the Wilderneſs, and was Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with Roots, and his Mother went about, and lived by the Alms of Paſſengers, the remainder of the Thirty Years, John abode in the Wilderneſs, and the Holy-Ghoſt accompanied him, and ſupplied him with Food and Rayment, and Inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37030:49"/>him with Revelations, and taught him what it behoved him to know;</p>
               <p>But why did he Fly to the Wilderneſs? We Anſwer, That there might not be any abſurd pretext, or opinion among Men, concerning what he was to Teſtifie of Chriſt; as firſt, That either he ſhould Teſtifie of him, for their being of Kin, or for the Love of their Parents, or for their ſociety from their Childhood; wherefore he was of Favour Tranſlated to the Wilderneſs, and remained there full thirty years, until both of them arrived at that perfect Age, wherein thoſe things that were to be ſpoken concerning the Goſpel, were to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and confirmed; and he came to open the Fountain of Baptiſm; and this was not of his own Will; but of the Will of God, as ſaith Luke. <hi>The Word of God was upon John;</hi> That is to ſay, His Command; and he came by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he who ſent me to Baptize, ſaid unto me,</hi> He <hi>whom thou ſeeſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was ſent to baptize that he might proclaim Chriſt to Iſrael; and that they hearing that he did baptize, the Jews might from all parts be gathered unto him, and he preach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt: And becauſe they were polluted with ſins, John came to put them in mind of their ſins, preparing them to Repentance by Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>The Lord John ſaith, That there was no Remiſſion of ſins in the Baptiſm of John, becauſe Chriſt was not yet ſacrificed on the Croſs, nor was the Spirit as yet given, nor was Sin ſlain: And Paul ſaith, That <hi>John baptized with the Baptiſm of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> but adds not, <hi>for Remiſſion of Sins?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how then do Mark and Luke ſay. That <hi>John did baptize for Remiſsion of ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord John ſays. Becauſe the Jews were Impoſtors, and that they might not onely not ſuffer for their Sins but alſo puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy their Souls, it was neceſſary that John ſhould ſay, I baptize for remiſſion of Sins, that he might put them in mind of their Sins, and prepare them for the baptiſm of Chriſt which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers remiſſion of Sins, as Paul ſay'd, <hi>Ye have been waſhed; ye have ſanctified,</hi> not by the Baptiſm of John, but <hi>by the Name of Chriſt, and by the Spirit of God.</hi>

                  <item>The third is the Figurative Law by Moſes, which is called of Purification, and they eat nothing out of the Market with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out waſhing; for thoſe who were clean by Nature, but by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident otherwiſe, as he who had touched a dead Carcaſe, or was defiled with Nocturnal Pollution, or had taſted what was prohibited, or went to the Houſe of Mourning, was therefore to purge himſelf by waſhing, and was not clean until the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</item>
                  <item>The Fourth is that of John, by water indeed, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which was ſuperiour to that of the Jews, but inferior to ours, it having neither the holy Ghoſt, nor remiſſion of Sins; which is manifeſt from hence, that Paul did again baptize thoſe who had been baptized therewith by Apollo of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria; and it ſerved as a bridge to paſs from that of Moſes to this of ours; there were not therein Bodily cleanſings, but it adviſed us to eſchue evil, and to perform works agreeable to Repentance.</item>
                  <item>The Fifth is that which Chriſt beſtowed upon us being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and beſtowing Adoption, Conferring Grace, and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Remiſſion of Sins, and freeing from debts, and is the Gift of the Spirit.</item>
                  <item>The Sixth is that of Martyrdom, for the Martyrs who
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:37030:50"/>were not baptized with water, and received the holy Ghoſt, and bare Teſtimony of Chriſt, and were Crowned, the blood of their necks ſupplyed the place of their baptiſme.</item>
                  <item>The ſeventh is that of Tears, which alſo procures remiſſion; for being it is Impoſſible for thoſe who have been once baptized, when they are ſpotted with Sin, to be re-baptized, God gave Tears, that when a Man weeps for his Sin, he might receive Remiſſion, and ſo the Gift of Baptiſm which he loſt, might return unto him; as David was baptized with Tears, when he ſinned and committed adultery.</item>
                  <item>The Eighth is another baptiſm which is by Fire, whereof ſpeaks Theologus, which happens when we are baptized in fire.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But with what baptiſme was our Lord baptized? St. Severus is of opinion that it was that of John, which was of repentance, for he who was no Sinner was reputed a ſinner, and he was not baptized as if he had ſtood in need of repentance, or to have received Remiſſion of Sins, or the holy Ghoſt; for he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no Sin, nor was there any guile in him; he ſay'd, <hi>Who reproves me of Sin?</hi> And he had no need of the Spirit, for he was of the ſame nature with him; wherefore as not wanting it, was he bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with the baptiſm of repentance, <hi>the over-ruling of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy,</hi> he was therefore baptiſed with the baptiſm of repentance and adoption, as being not baptized for himſelf but for us; it was ſay'd to be one and the ſame baptiſm wherewith he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, but he was baptized for us, that he might Sanctify us by his baptiſm; he aboliſhed the baptiſm of the Jews, and gave us that of adoption, as he Celebrated the Paſſover, aboliſhing the old, and inſtituting the new. <hi>Philoxenus,</hi> He was baptized with our baptiſm that he might beſtow it upon us, for it is a type of his death and reſurrection; and as he died and roſe again, and was to us the firſt fruit from the dead, ſo was he baptized for the ſanctification of our baptiſm, and preſently he beſtowed it upon us, for he was baptized that he might be proclaimed to Iſrael, and that he might fulfill the whole Law, that is righteouſneſs, and that he might prepare adoption for us, and make us his Sons and Domeſticks, and that he might draw the holy Ghoſt on our fleſh by the means of his fleſh, and that he might make void the firſt Condemnation, and that he might open unto us
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37030:50"/>the Heavens which were ſhut up, by Tranſgreſſion of the Commandments, and that he might Sanctifie Waters, and ſhew them unto us, as Enlightning, Holy, and Conferring Remiſſion, and that he might Sanctifie the Baptiſt, and that he who once caſt into the Water, in the time of Pharoah, the known Serpent which crept in the VVater, might bruiſe his Head, and that he might Root Sin out of the VVaters, as he took it upon him when he was Crucified, and that he might Reveal the Trinity upon the VVaters, and that he might put an end to (former) VVaſhings, and bodily Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, and that Spiritual Baptiſm might be believed, which is from Water and the Spirit; whereat, Nicodemus made difficulty; and that he might waſh away the Filth of Sin that is in us, and that he might by the Spirit and Water, perfect Jordan, as he is Spirit and Fleſh.</p>

                  <hi>ANd it came to paſs when Jeſus had finiſhed theſe ſpeeches he ſaid to his diſciples, Ye know that after two days the paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over will be.</hi> Our Redeemer ſpoke this on the mount of Olives, but Luke ſaith that he came on the day of unleavened Bread; and John ſaid, fix days before the paſſover; he who heard thoſe, how can he theſe? Jeſus came to Bethanie on the Sabbath day when he raiſed Lazarus, and he made him a ſupper, and he raiſed Lazarus, and Martha miniſtred, and Mary waſhed his ſeet; the next day after, which was the firſt day of the week, he entred into Jeruſalem with Hoſanna's, as ſay'd John; and on that firſt dayof the week, he went forth into Bethanie and lodged there, as ſaid Mathew; and in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſecond day of the week he returned to Jeruſalem, and dried up the fig Tree, as Mathew ſay'd; and again on the third day of the week he went forth to the mouth of olives, as Mathew ſaid, and ſat upon the Mount, and his Diſciples came unto him, and ſpoke unto him, and he taught many things; and on this third day, he ſaid unto them there on the Mount, <hi>After two days will be the paſſover;</hi> that is, after the fourth and fifth day of the week the paſſover was to be Early in the morning of the preparation, and on that third day Chriſt was anointed in the houſe of Simon the Leper, in the town of Bethanie, as ſay Mathew and Mark; and from Bethanie where he was anointed, he ſent two Diſciples, Peter and John, to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem on the fifth day, to prepare for him the paſſover, as Luke ſayeth, <hi>The Day of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>leavened Bread being come,</hi> &amp;c. and when it was the evening of the dawning of the Friday, he came to Jeruſalem, and lay down in the Parlour, with his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples as ſayeth Mathew; and the firſt day of the paſſover and of unleavened bread was the Friday, as John ſayeth, which was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37030:52"/>the preparation of the paſſover, and they entred not into the Pretorium, that they might not be defiled; and if thou ſhalt reckon from the Sabbath whereon Lazarus aroſe, until the preparation, there will be ſix days, as ſayeth John; from whence it is apparent that the Evangeliſts agree with one another, for Mathew ſaid, Ye know that after two days ſhall be the paſſover, that is, on the third day of the Week, he ſaid this unto them; and the fourth and fifth days of the Week were two interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate days, and on the Friday happened the firſt of Unleaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bread, whereon the Paſſover of that year was ſlain, and whereon Chriſt was crucified, as ſaid John.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Son of Man ſhall be betrayed to be crucified:</hi> Firſt of all he introduced the matter of the Paſſover, that he might conceal that which would have affected them with ſadneſs, that is, that he was to be Crucifyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then were gathered together the chief Prieſts and Scribes:</hi> For the Law had commanded there ſhould be but one High Prieſt, and that when he died another ſhould ſucceed; for with the life of this one, he meaſured the flight of thoſe who had involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily ſlain a man; but at this time their Laws were corrupted, for inſtead of one Chief Prieſt, many ſucceeded.</p>
               <p>Moreover, he ſet up unto them two Chief Prieſts, to the end that if there ſhould happen to one of them Nocturnal Pollution, or any Liquefaction, and he ſhould be polluted, the other might adminiſter without any diſappointment to the Feaſt. But Herod when he reigned as King, he made one High Prieſt every year, that they might not rebel againſt him: He made them alſo to exerciſe that Prieſthood for certain years, as Zachary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they took Counſel againſt Jeſus to take him by deceipt:</hi> For they were aſſembled unto the Court of Caiaphas the high Prieſt, and after four days from the raiſing of Lazarus, being the fourth day of the Week, they took Counſel for his Death; and therefore the Apoſtles appointed that on the fourth day of the Week, on the Friday, and on the firſt day of the Week, there ſhould be a Faſt, and the holy Myſteries. On the fourth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they conſulted his Death on that day; on the Friday, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thereon he was Crucifyed; and on the firſt day of the Week, becauſe on that day he aroſe.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:37030:52"/>
               <p>Some ſay, That even the Beaſts, on this <hi>Friday</hi> Honour the Faſt. <hi>Not in the Feaſt, leſt there be a Commotion among the People:</hi> Obſerve, That they were not afraid of God, but of the People; And obſerve, The Devil did not conſent, that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer in the Feaſt, that his Paſſion might not be Publick; but becauſe, They were overcome with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing Rage unlawfully, and found Judas ready to betray him; they could not Govern their Rage. They Conſulted in the Court of Caiphas; becauſe, He was the Chief Prieſt for that year: And ſome ſay, That he was Joſephus, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward Repented, was Converted, and Believed in Chriſt; but we ſay, That the Joſephus who fought ſmartly with the Romans, and afterwards was taken by them, made a Diſciple, and wrote many Books, concerning what happened in the time of the Machabees; and alſo, concerning the War of Jeruſalem, was another than this Caiaphas the High Prieſt; and Euſebius Caeſarienſis in his Eccleſiaſticks Teſtifieth unto us the ſame; but Joſephus was called the Second Joſeph by the Romans, by reaſon of his Wiſdom; and he ſaid of Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſian, <hi>It will come to paſs that he ſhall Reign.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus being in Bethany in the Houſe of Simon the Leper.</hi> This Bethany was the Village of Mary, and of Martha, wherein Lazarus aroſe from the Dead; and it is Interpreted, <hi>The Houſe of Praiſe,</hi> and this is differing from Jeruſalem; and it is evident from this, That when the Sinner Anointed him there; he ſaid afterwards, <hi>Go unto the City, and prepare the Paſſover for us;</hi> hereby the Evangeliſts ſhewed, That he ſent them from Bethany to the City of Jeruſalem: This Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was a Leper, and was Cured, and the Name of Leper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained on him; perhaps, for that afterwards he grew Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous in his mind, and was Scandalized in our Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There came unto him a Woman who had with her an Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſter.</hi> The Woman was incouraged to come unto our Lord, from this, That ſhe ſaw he had Cured Simon the Leper, and for that he had Cured many Women, the Canaanite, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan, ſhe that was Wounded, and others; and ſhe did not come unto him as a Man, but as to God made Man.

                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:37030:53"/>by reaſon that Luke ſaith, ſhe was a Sinner, and that it was in the Houſe of Simon, and in Nain; but Mathew ſaith, in Bethany, in the Houſe of Simon the Leper, but doth not ſignifie her Name; but John manifeſtly ſignifies it, and ſaith, that her Name was Mary. Some ſay, That they were two, by reaſon of the places; Others, That ſhe was one and the ſame, ſhe having Anointed him twice, and being the Siſter of Lazarus, which was called Magdalen; Others ſay, That Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the Phariſee was Simon the Leper, the Father of Lazarus and Mary; Others, That they were three; the Whores A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed him twice, and Mary once; once he was Anointed at Nain, and a ſecond time by Mary the Siſter of Lazarus, in Bethany, in the Houſe of Lazarus her Brother, ſix days before the Paſſover; Luke ſaith, That ſhe Anointed him in the Houſe of Simon the Phariſee; John ſaith in Bethanie, in the Houſe of Lazarus; Mathew and Mark ſay, in the Houſe of Simon the Leper; The Lord John ſaith, That he was Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twice; Saint Severus, unto whom we aſſent, ſaith, That he was Anointed thrice, once at Nain, as ſaid Luke, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Evangeliſt; and it is evident from this, That ſoon after he Raiſed the Lad, the Son of a Widow in Nain; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time, the Siſter of Lazarus Anointed him in Bethanie, ſix days before the Paſſover, in their Houſe, when her Brother Lazarus roſe from the Dead: Moreover, The third time in Bethanie, two days before the Paſſover; and John ſaid, that ſhe Anointed the Feet of Chriſt; but Mathew, two days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Paſſover, when he was in the Houſe of Simon the Leper, there came a Woman, and poured Oyl on Chriſt's Head, as he was at Table; and from that which he ſaid to Lazarus, and another to Simon; and John ſaying, That ſhe Anointed the Feet, and Mathew the Head; it is clear, That he was thrice Anointed, and from the manner, and from the Place, and from the time, it is evident, That it was not one Anointing but three, and three Women; and if ſhe who was the Sinner in Nain, were the ſame that came unto him two days before the Paſſover and Anointed him: There will be computed two VVomen according to the Diſcourſe of the Lord John, and three Anointings, according to what Saint Severus hath written</p>

                  <hi>What will ye give me?</hi> Heaven and Earth are too little to be the Price of what thou wert to ſell; becauſe, they are Creatures, but he is the Creator; and the Creature is not at all to be exchanged, or to be a Price for the Creator; it was not conceived how he ſhould betray him, who had revived three dead Men before him; and had he not yielded, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and been willing, they could not have Crucified him; yet in this, That Judas betrayed him, and the Jews Crucified him, they did not perform his Will, but the contrary; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, He for the Redemption of Men, was willing to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed and Crucified; but Judas and the Jews did not betray him for the Redemption of Men, but to Murther him, and to deſtroy his Name; Therefore, though he was willing, yet they did not Act his Will, but the contrary; and therefore they are Accuſed and Condemned: Satan entred into Judas, and not into his Fellows, becauſe he found in him the Paſſion of Coveteouſneſs. Luke addeth, and the Prefect of the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia of the Temple; that is, an Officer of the Guard; for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Principality of the Jews was fallen away, and the High-Prieſts were continually in Commotion among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; the Romans placed in the Temple with them, Officers of the Militia, that they might not be unruly, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Temple with them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And from that time he ſought an opportunity;</hi> That is, a Conveniency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, a time and ſeaſon, free from the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, or Tumult of many: Moreover, He ſought a time when the people and multitude which he taught might not be found with him, becauſe he was afraid of the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One of ye ſhall betray me.</hi> Hitherto, he ſpoke Myſtically, concerning his being to be betrayed; but here, plainly; and by theſe Words, <hi>One of ye,</hi> he troubled them all, every one of them was afraid of himſelf, leſt it might be lie; and by this, that he ſaid, one of all them; he ſhewed, that he did not miſtake who it was; but he did not Publiſh him, in reſpect that he might be Converted, and he terrified them all, that he might preſerve him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they were very ſad.</hi> Fear and grief laid hold on them, and they began to ſay unto him, every one of them particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for they believed his VVords, more than their Knowledg, and they Confeſſed, that he knew them better, than they knew themſelves; John.

                  <hi>Then he Anſwered and ſaid, He who dips his Hand with me in the Diſh;</hi> That is, he detected him, that his Fellows might not dye with fear; and he ſtruck him with the Name of Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that peradventure, he might Repent; for this, <hi>Shall dip wlth me,</hi> is thus Expounded by Sanctus Johannes; he was ſo Unmannerly and Impudent, that he did not honour the Lord, but dipped with him; but it ſeems to me, That he ſpoke to make him aſhamed, and as drawing him to Lover; <hi>Ye are they who Eat with me freely, and yet one of ye ſhall betray me?</hi> That is, <hi>He who ſhall betray me is not from without, but is of thoſe who dip the hand with me in the Diſh;</hi> VVas it requiſite that they ſhould dip in any thing, ſince that it is commanded in the Law, That nothing ſhall be Eaten, that is made with

We Anſwer, That they dipped in fitting Sauces, where with Roaſted Meat was to be Eaten, as being a young Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for they did alſo eat a Roaſted Lamb after the Old Rule. Saint Hypolitus, Although all the Diſciples ſtretched forth their Hands with him into the Diſh, yet when our Lord ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth his Hand, they drew back their hands, but Judas did not ſo, but impudently ſtretched forth his hand, together with him into the Diſh, as if he had been his equal; and this is that he, who ſhall dip his hand; and when from hence the Diſciples did not underſtand who was the Traytor, he dipped Bread and gave, and immediately they knew him: Others, They did ſet before them two Diſhes and each ſix of them dipped in one Diſh, and Judas was of that Company which dipped with our Lord, and therefore he ſaid, <hi>That he who ſhall dip with me ſhall betray me:</hi> Some ſay, That he did not Reveal the Traytor, until he waſhed their Feet, and gave them the Myſtery; but this is not true.</p>

For Barabbas reſembled Adam, for as Barabbas Sinned and was bound; ſo Adam by reaſon he had Sinned was bound in Hell, and as Chriſt was Crucified and Barabbas looſed; ſo was Adam looſed from the Chains of Hell, Chriſt being Crucified for him.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Crucifie him;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">22.</note> That is to ſay, hang him on a Tree; for they did not ſay, <hi>Murther him,</hi> or put him to Death; but, <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him;</hi> that they might give out concerning him, that he was a Seducer, and Blaſphemer; therefore deſerv'd to be Crucified; and for that Crucifixion was a Reproachful Death, they cryed, <hi>Let him be Crucified:</hi> Moreover, That they might bring him under the Curſe of the Law; <hi>Curſed be every one that hangeth on a Tree;</hi> and altho, they did fulfil this out of an Evil Conſcience, yet Divine Diſpenſation confirm'd that by their Mouths what he had foretold, he would bring to paſs, that <hi>He ſhould dye the Death of the Croſs:</hi> Moreover, As the Crucifying of him was the Cauſe of many Evils; ſo the ingeminating of the Word, <hi>Crucifie, Crucifie,</hi> was a great indication of their Fury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He took Water and waſhed his Hands;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. 24.</note> For he was brought to a ſtreight, by the Commotion of the People againſt him; becauſe of his Words, which imported that Chriſt was Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; therefore he called for Water and Waſhed, that by the Waſhing of his Hands, he might ſignifie the Purity of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, from being guilty of this Judgment, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Law of Righteouſneſs; yet Pilate was culpable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he appeared to be Puſillanimous,<note place="margin">Pilate proved guilty of Chriſt's Death.</note> and Timerous; had reſpect to perſons, and was willing to pleaſe the Jews; for he might juſtly have ſuffer'd him to have eſcaped from them, if he had pleaſed, as the Centurion permitted Paul to go his way; for he alſo knew it was a Commotion &amp; Tumult, yet would not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore permit the Jews to put him to Death: But ſome ſay, Pilate durſt not ſet him at Liberty; becauſe, they ſaid, he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a King; but it behoved him to have enquir'd, whether he had found in him any kind of Rebellion; whether he had provided any Ammunition, whether he had Rais'd Souldiers. Now ſince he diſcover'd no ſuch thing, and was induced to have reſpect to Perſons, Chriſt did not free him from Guilt; it is certain therefore, that his Fault was a ſluggiſh Weakneſs, or ſoftneſs of Temper.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:37030:59"/>
               <p>Others ſay, That foraſmuch as he ſaw that his Wife had ſent unto him, and the Jews were ſtirred up againſt him, he knew not to which Party he ſhou'd encline; and being thus brought into Doubts and Shame, he ſhou'd according to the Cuſtom then in uſe amongſt them, have freed Jeſus; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Feaſt they let looſe a Priſoner.</p>
               <p>Pilate was a Type of the Gentiles, who were not guilty of the Blood of Chriſt; for tho' he were of the Gentiles, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hov'd the Jews to Repent, by reaſon of what Judas ſaid, <hi>I have Sinned,</hi> and for that he hanged himſelf; as alſo for the Dream of Pilate's Wife, for the Waſhing the hands of Pilate himſelf, for his Prayer in their behalf; <hi>Father forgive them;</hi> and for the Miracles which were wrought on the Croſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His Blood be upon us;</hi> That is to ſay, let his Judgment be Avenged on us, if we have not juſtly deliver'd him unto thee. Moreover, They ſay, that even ſenſibly in matter of Fact and Reality, this ſticks unto them, for the Smell of Blood conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually Reeks from them. Furthermore, O Jew! if he did offend, wherefore doſt thou draw his Blood on thy ſelf, and ſhew'd, that he is blameleſs; foraſmuch as thou haſt drawn his Blood on thy own Head. Again they drew Blood on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Children, and engaged for the Infidelity of their Children; and that Rebellion ſhould ſtick unto them; but our Saviour did not confirm the Sentence upon them, but receiv'd as many of them as Repented, as Paul, the Phariſees, and very many of thoſe who believed in Judea.</p>

Again, this was the Law with the Romans, that he that was to be Crucified, muſt firſt be Scourg'd with Whips; which he practis'd with our Lord, whom he Scourg'd, and then deliver'd him over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Souldiers of the Governour;</hi> That is to ſay, the Executioners, who Miniſtred under him, went to the Preto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37030:60"/>in which Caeſars Image ſtood, and wherein was drawn together the Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The whole Band;</hi> That is to ſay, the Company of Roman Soldiers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they took off his Garments.</hi> This is the Myſtery; as the Sheep was before the Shearers, and the Shearers flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Sheep of his Wool, he taking off his Garments, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced Principalities and Power; for as the firſt Adam was Naked among the Trees; ſo the Second <hi>Adam</hi> was left Naked in the place of Judgment.</p>

                  <hi>And they put on him a Scarlet Robe.</hi> When a King or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of the Romans was inaugurated, theſe Five Things were done unto him.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. He was Cloathed with Purple Robes.</item>
                  <item>2. A Diadem of Pearls was put on his Head.</item>
                  <item>3. A Scepter of Gold was put in his Hands.</item>
                  <item>4. His Miniſters fell on their Knees and Worſhipped him.</item>
                  <item>5. They Saluted him, ſaying, <hi>Hail our King.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>And becauſe they ſaid, that the Cauſe of his Death was Treaſon againſt Caeſar; therefore, in this deluding manner did they put on him this Purple Robe, and ſet on his Head the Crown of Thorns, and made him hold in his Hand a Reed, and Worſhipped him; ſaying, <hi>Hail King of the Jews; for behold, now thou art made King of the Jews, as thou ſoughteſt to be, and as Pilate called thee.</hi> This Coat called Clamys, had no Seam, and one of the Kings Dedicated, and gave it to God and the Temple in Jeruſalem; 'twas Dyed in the Blood of a Fiſh called in the Latin Tongue, <hi>Murex.</hi> Garments dipped in this Blood, yield two different Colours in two different places; in the Light of the Sun it appears Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but in the Shade Scarlet; and not as ſome ſay, that the Figuration thereof was Purple, and the ground Scarlet: But John inſtead of a Clamys, ſaith Purple. Theſe were placed in the Temple, and were beſtowed by the Aegyptian and Grecian Kings, on the Kings of the <hi>Macchabees;</hi> theſe the Prieſts fetch'd from the Temple, and preſented them to Pilate, and ſaid, <hi>Behold the Purple which befits him, ſeeing that driving at the Kingdom, he Rebels againſt Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:37030:60"/>
               <p>Some ſay, That this Coat was given by the Grecians to Jonathan Machabeus.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, That this Garment wherewith the Soldiers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roabed him, was brought by the Prieſts from the Temple, and did ſo, becauſe they fear'd he ſhould fail to dye, and therefore brought this Robe from the Temple, and Cloath'd him therewith; that if any thing ſhould happen in hindrance of his Death, they might have ſaid, <hi>He cannot be ſaved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he touch'd the Holy Veſtment, being no Prieſt; and it's certain, that the Law requires he ſhould dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others ſay, This happen'd by Divine Providence; for ſeeing they were to ſtrip the Altar of his Father, he ſent a Garment to cover it: Furthermore, They Cloathed him with a Clamys of Scarlet, for it was lawful only for Kings to wear Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let.</p>
               <p>Others think there were two Garments, and that at firſt, they put on the Scarlet, that is to ſay, the Red Robe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards that of Purple, and every one of the Evangeliſts ſay the ſame thing; Mathew calls it from the Ground, others from the Figure.</p>
               <p>Others ſay it was one, but yeilded a ſhew or caſt of two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, Moreover by their cloathing him with Purple, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored unto us the Glory whereof we deveſted our ſelves in tranſgreſſing the commandments, and this ſhall be compleated in the world to come.</p>
               <p>Purple ſignifies his Kingdom, his Humanity, his Divinity, but Scarlet ſignifies his Humanity, his Blood, the Bloody Sin which he nailed to the Croſs. Furthermore, John ſays <hi>that they plaited a Crown of thorns and cover'd him with purple Cloaths,</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew ſays <hi>that the Soldiers of the Governour cloathed him with a garment of Scarlet, and therewith derided him;</hi> Mark ſaith that the Soldiers led him to the Praetorium or Judgment ſeat, and cloathed him with Purple, and put on him a Crown of thorns: Luke ſaith that <hi>Herod as well as his Soldiers deſpiſed him, and derided him, cloathed him with Scarlet Robes, and ſent him to Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> both Herod and the Soldiers derided him, and deſired to apply unto him ſuch things as belonged unto the King, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37030:61"/>one made thorns a Crown for him, and another put into his hand a Reed, after the ſimilitude of a Scepter; and one of the chief Prieſts brought the Robe and gave it to the Soldiers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to deride him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jacobus de Sarug</hi> ſayeth that theſe were one of the Purple Robes of one of the Kings which had been offered to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as we have formerly ſay'd, and in this Goſpel it is only writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that the Soldiers of Herod did put it upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they plaited a Crown of thorns</hi> that is to ſay the Crown which they put upon him, there were two things in it, a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference (or circle) and thorns of brambles, which were great and bloſſoming, and they grew in Woods and watery places; the Crown of thorns was for a Diadem, he was adorned with a Crown after the manner of a Victorious Champion, as God, and King; the Crown of thorns in token of rooting out the Curſe againſt <hi>Adam, the Earth is Curſed for thy ſake.</hi> Furthermore, as the firſt Adam planted the Curſe and Briars, ſo the ſecond Adam has Eradicated the Curſe, and the bryars, by a Crown of thorns. Moreover he has taken away the univerſal Sin which encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the world, for his Crown was Circular, wherein were tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting thorns, a type of Sin tormenting the Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And a Reed in his right hand;</hi> A Reed inſtead of a Staff of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; that is to ſay, a Scepter and Rod of Gold, ſuch as Kings uſed to bear in their hands, but otherwiſe then they deſigned, they ſignified the truth of things which were to come to paſs; for by the Reed in his right hand, he gave a demonſtration of his never failing authority, ſignifying that by this Scepter he would cancel the Inſtrument of Obligation, which was written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us by Adam; a Signification alſo it was, of the Killing and Wounding of that Serpent which Inchanted Eve; for a Reed is naturally terrible to a Serpent; and we are uſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to torment and kill Serpents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they Kneeled on their Knees.</hi> Genuflection and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſignifie, the Converſion of the Gentiles to our Saviour, and delivery from Idolatry, and that he would make us his True Worſhippers.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And they Spat on his Face;</hi> That the Prophecy of Iſaiah may be fulfilled; <hi>I have not turned my Face from the Contumely of Spittle; and the Phariſees who are Domeſticks, my Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father has permitted them to be Rebels and Actors againſt me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they took a Reed;</hi> Viz. The Reed which he held in his Hand, and ſtruck him therewith on the Head, that he might Exalt our declined heads, who by our Deeds was brought low. During the time of all theſe contumelious Reproaches, neither the Prieſts, nor Elders, nor People of the Jews drew near, but ſtood afar off; and Judg'd, that foraſmuch as they had not yet Eaten the Paſſover, and had preſerv'd themſelves from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with the Gentiles, they ſhou'd be unpolluted; for tho' they might have eaten it from the Evening, they put it off till they had put Chriſt to Death, that ſo they might eat the Paſſover without fear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou hadſt had no Power againſt me at all, had it not been given thee from above;</hi> That is as much as to ſay, The Father has withdrawn <hi>his Grace,</hi> and left thee to thy Liberty of doing this; and it is known, he was guilty of Sin, from what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the ſame Verſ. <hi>Wherefore, he that betray'd me unto thee, his Sin is greater than thine;</hi> whereby he ſheweth, That Pilate was guilty of Sin, altho the Sin of the Jews was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his; and he concludes him under Guilt, becauſe he pronounced him Innocent; and yet ſet at Liberty one that was Guilty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Place called the Pavement;</hi> Viz. A place which was laid even, and flagged with Stones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pilate ſaid unto them, ſhall I Crucifie your King?</hi> Hereby he Reproach'd them, but they would not be put to ſhame: Moreover he derides them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They ſay unto him, We have no King but Caeſar:</hi> Hereby they wou'd have terrified Pilate; and becauſe they denied him, even at this great Feaſt came upon them the mighty Deſtruction of Titus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They found a Man of Cyrene, whoſe Name was Simon.</hi> Our Lord firſt bore his Croſs, and went out of the Pretorium, and afterwards they made Simon the Father of Alexander, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37030:62"/>Ruſus to bear it: The Wood of the Croſs was called <hi>Sahka</hi> which ſignifieth Pardon or Remiſſion, and they took it from Solomons Porch, and one of the Croſſes was of Cedar, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Fig-Tree. My Lord John ſaith, That this Wood was ſet up as a Sign, to the end, that though they could not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto it, yet they might ſee it; others ſay, That it was of that Tree which held an Offering in the place of Iſaac; for Abraham cut it down, and brought it for a Teſtimony, and it was preſerv'd till the coming of Chriſt; and they perceived that it was placed in the Porch, and brought it away; and the firſt Judgment that was given in the Porch, was that of the two Harlots whom Solomon Judged, and the latter, was that of our Lord; after which it was deſtroyed, and no more Judgments given therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Him they compelled to bear his Croſs.</hi> Obſerve, they accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Chriſt, becauſe he bad the Man ſick of the Palſie to take up his Bed; and theſe, on a Day to be doubly Honour'd, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled Simon: he who gathered Sticks on the Sabbath Day was Stoned, and theſe made a Jew bear Wood on the Sabbath, and that which was worſe, they Crucified Chriſt, and the Thieves on the day of the Feaſt.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, That Simon was a Jew, but of the Gentiles; they gave his Croſs to Simon to bear, by way of Diſgrace; as others bear Enſigns of Royalty to a King, ſo they made Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bear his Croſs. And this is certain from hence, that it is not Written, that the Thieves did bear their Croſſes, but that there came with him two Malefactors. And as Simon bare his Croſs and was not Crucified, ſo our Lord was Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied not for himſelf, but for others: Furthermore, when Satan perceived what good things <hi>there came</hi> from the Croſs, he made the Jews give his Croſs to another, that the Good which was to be wrought by <hi>his</hi> Death, might come to paſs by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means, and not by the hands of Jeſus; and that all the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might look upon him who carried the Croſs, and not upon Jeſus. Yet the Will of Satan was not performed; for tho' another bore the Croſs, yet the Croſs bore Jeſus, and all the Good was wrought by him.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:37030:62"/>
               <p>Again he did as did the ancient Patriarchs and Prophets; for they indeed prophecied and did not ſuffer; but Simon carried the Croſs, and another was Crucified: Moreover, it was to teach us, that whoſoever will be his Diſciple, muſt take up his Croſs; and that the Prophecy might be fulfilled, <hi>that his Dominion is upon his ſhoulder;</hi> that is to ſay his Croſs, by which he exerciſeth Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over things in Heaven, and Earth; and as Iſaac bore on his Shoulder the Wood of his Sacrifice, ſo our Lord bore upon his Shoulder the Croſs.</p>
               <p>Wherefore did not God permit Abraham to ſlay Iſaac? That the Seed of Abraham might not follow the Cuſtom of the Prophane Gentiles, who Sacrificed their Sons to Devils, and to learn by Abraham, that God delights not in Slaughter, but in true Love.</p>
               <p>But ſince there are many kinds of Death, Why did he ſuffer the Death of the Croſs? To the end, that when he ſhould be lifted upon the Croſs, he might draw all Men to him from the Earth; and that he might Sanctifie the Earth, by the Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his Blood: Moreover, That he might publiſh the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off his Fleſh to the Principalities; for the Powers of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan for the moſt part reſide in the Air: Again, becauſe by the Tree alſo, Death entered; ſo by the Tree came Salvation, when he was mounted thereupon; and that he might free us from this Curſe, <hi>Curſed be the Earth for thy ſake;</hi> he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Curſed Death, according to what he ſaid, <hi>Curſed be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one who hangeth upon a Tree;</hi> and that he might bleſs us with all the Bleſſings of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And there came behind him a multitude of People and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who Lamented;</hi> This was the cuſtom, that when any ſad thing happened, the people gathered themſelves together, and Women grieved and wept.</p>
               <p>And this is it which is ſaid in John; <hi>Ye ſhall ſeek me, and ſhall not find me.</hi> My Lord John ſaith, <hi>Here they ſought him Lamenting and Weeping for him.</hi> Cyril ſaith, <hi>That they Wept and Lamented,</hi> becauſe Woman kind are prone to Tears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their ſoft Conſtitutions, or Tenderneſs of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Moreover, the Weeping and Wayling of the Women, was a Sign of the Deſtruction of their City.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:37030:63"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Weep for your ſelves and your Children;</hi> That is to ſay, a bitter Deſtruction is coming upon you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed are the Barren;</hi> That is to ſay, you ſhall count them happy who have no Children, when ye ſhall ſee this ſharp Deſtruction from the Romans.</p>

                  <hi>If with the Green Tree.</hi> Green he calls himſelf, who was Delightful and Fruitful; That is to ſay, he wrought Miracles, affording Teaching and Preaching; and if after theſe things, the Romans and Grecians Reproached and Deſpiſed me; <hi>What will become of you?</hi> What will they do with you, who are dry Wood, and fruitleſs; becauſe they find nothing uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in you, they will have no Pity for you. Chriſt is the Green Tree, the Jews the Dry, and the Romans the Fire.</p>

                  <hi>And they came to a place which is called Gagultha, which is Interpreted a Skull;</hi> that is to ſay, the Syrians call the Pan and bone of the Head, a Skull; but Interpreters ſay, that when Noah enter'd into the Ark, he took with him the Bones of Adam; and that going out of the ſame, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided them among his three Sons; to Shem as to his firſt born, he gave his Head, to Ham and Japheth the reſt of his Bones; accordingly, he divided the Earth between them three, to Japheth fell the Northern part, to Ham the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern, and to Shem the Middlemoſt, to which belonged Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem; and they ſay, that by way of Myſtery, the Skull of Adam was buried in the ſelf ſame place and Earth whereon Chriſt was Crucified; and that when Chriſt was Crucified, they fix'd his Croſs in the Mouth of Adam, to the intent, That in the very place where Death and the Fall firſt happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Life and Reſurrection might there begin. Moreover, he was Crucified in this place; becauſe, therein were Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred the Myſteries which prefigured the Crucifixion; for from Generations, and many years it was kept for this Uſe.

               <p>
                  <hi>And they divided them into four Parts;</hi> becauſe there were four Chieftains of the Soldiers; and he had a Tunick, an head-covering, a Shaſh, and Sandals; and becauſe the Shaſh was ſmall, they were willing to divide the Tunick, and to add to the Girdle, for the which (becauſe they divided it not) they caſt Lotts, and it fell to one of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They divided his Garments into four Parts:</hi> The Myſtery hereof is, that they were guilty of four-fold Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What every one ſhould take;</hi> that is to ſay, what part of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of the Souldiers ſhould take of his Garments, and who ſhould have the Tunick, or Girdle</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His Tunick was Seamleſs from the top, being all Woven:</hi> It was the cuſtom in the Land of Paleſtine, to weave two pieces of Cloth, and to ſtich them together above the ſhoulders, and ſo make a Tunick, and they called it <hi>without ſeam from the top,</hi> that is to ſay, woven without, that ſtitch above the ſhoulders. Moreover that it was ſeamleſs, ſhews the meanleſs of his attire. Furthermore, he calls his Body a Tunick, and that it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeam from above, ſheweth, that he brought not his Body from Heaven but that it was united to him from Mary; and in as much as it was intirely woven, is ſignified, that the <hi>Word</hi> united to it ſelf a compleat living Body, endowed with a Rational Soul; and that they did not divide it, ſheweth, that after this union, Our Lord was not to be divided, or ſeperated
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37030:64"/>into two <hi>ſubſiſtances.</hi> Again his Tunick ſignifieth faith, which is one and undivided, and that there is one Lord undivided into two, and incomprehenſible; his Coat fell to the Soldiers, who were of the Gentiles, and not of the Hebrews; becauſe, the Gentiles were heirs to the faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they ſat and watched him;</hi> that he ſhould not be ſnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched away by his Kinsfolks; and this they did peculiarly, as to our Lord, at the command of Pilate; or they watched him, to obſerve whether or no he was dead; and they put over his head, the cauſe of his Death: Luke and John ſay, That it was written <hi>in</hi> three languages; Hebrew, Latine, and Greek; Pilate did this, that he might be revenged of the Jews, and that he might excuſe himſelf, for that they accuſed him as a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor; moreover, this was the guidance of divine providence; for the Croſſes were hidden under ground; and a long time after this was known to be that of Chriſt, by the Table which the Judge had placed thereon,</p>
               <p>Others ſay, that he feared, leaſt that when enquiry ſhould be made after his death, and he found innocent, he himſelf might be accuſed and therefore wrote on the Croſs, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his Death, in three Tables, that three languages might teſtifie that the Jews crucified their King: Moreover three witneſſes gave teſtimony, alluding to this, that they Crucified one of the Trinity. But the Writing pleaſed them not becauſe they thought they ſhould be thereby reputed Rebels, if he who was their King were crucified; they ſayed therefore, <hi>Write that he ſay'd he was King;</hi> and not that we owned him as ſuch; but he did not alter the Inſcription, becauſe Judges are not accuſtomed to vary from what they write, as alſo that he might reproach the Jews.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And two Thieves were crucified with him;</hi> he on the right hand was called <hi>Titus,</hi> and he on the left hand, <hi>Domeus.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over they did this with an impudent intention, that forasmuch as they crucified him with Thieves and Murderers, he might be deemed one of like guilt with them; and that by a pretended community in ſo flagitious a Crime, his Majeſty might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured. But againſt their will he fulfilled the Prophecy, in that <hi>he was crucified with evil doers.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>If thou beeſt the Son of God, come down from the Croſs:</hi> But he did not deſcend from the Croſs, becauſe he was the Son of God; for he who knows that if he dyes, he ſhall not riſe again, flyeth from Death; But it became not him who is aſſured to riſe after <hi>3</hi> days, and by his Deaths to deſtroy Hell, and triumph over Death, to have come down until Juſtice had been fully ſatisfied by his Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And likewiſe the High Prieſts reviled him:</hi> That is to ſay, the Seribes, the Doctors of the Law, the Prieſts and the Elders who were there aſſembled, to take care that the Execution ſhould not be delay'd nor prevented.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Thieves alſo who were crucified with him, reviled him:</hi> Some ſay that one of the Thieves only reviled him, and that he took up the reproach of one, and extended it to them both, according to the cuſtom of the Scripture: As for Example, <hi>On
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37030:65"/>my Rayment did they caſt Lots;.</hi> whereas it is evident that they did not caſt Lots upon is whole Rayment, but on his Tunick only.</p>
               <p>Like unto this, <hi>Some of them doubted;</hi> whereas Thomas on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doubted.</p>
               <p>Mathew and Mark ſay, that <hi>both of them reviled him,</hi> and all three ſay true; for when our Lord was nailed to the Croſs, both reviled him; but after that he on the Right Hand ſaw the Wonders and Signs which were wrought on the Croſs, and knew that they were not effected for his or his Fellows ſake, and heard the Jews repeating high things of him, and calling him the Son of God, and King of Iſrael, and ſaw the Inſcription of Pilate in three Tables, proclaiming him King, he confeſſed his Majeſty, and ceaſed to blaſpheme, and began with Praiſe, even reprehending and accuſing his Fellow. Moreover the Thief on the Left Hand had one reprehenſible property, for he blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as did the Jews, judging him to be God:</p>
               <p>But there were five praiſe-worthy Actions to be obſerved in the Thief on the Right Hand:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. He rebuked his Fellow.</item>
                  <item>2. He confeſſed the wickedneſs of his Deeds.</item>
                  <item>3. He Juſtified Chriſt.</item>
                  <item>4. He acknowledg'd him to be King.</item>
                  <item>5, He begged, ſaying, <hi>Remember me, my Lord.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>How knew the Thief that Chriſt was King?</p>
               <p>We anſwer, That either he knew it by Divine Revelation, the Teſtimony of Pilate, who ſaid, <hi>Shall I crucify your King?</hi> or of the Jews, <hi>If he be King, let him come down.</hi> For the Faith of the Thief is to be praiſed, for that he believed on him when he was in diſgrace, and on the Croſs, and not in his Kingdom and Majeſty. So alſo the Chriſtians, great was their Faith, and Rewards ſhall be given unto them, becauſe they believed in a Crucified Saviour, who notwithſtanding is <hi>God over all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, The Thief being a Malefactor, who with one Word gained a Kingdom, ſheweth that Chriſt is a Propitiation for Sins, and Lord of a Kingdom; but he was not Crucified as he was God, but as he was made Man; according to this, That
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37030:65"/>
                  <hi>the Word was made Fleſh, and dwelt in as;</hi> and according to this, <hi>God ſent his Son, and he was made of a Woman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some demand whether on the Friday he took up the Thief into Paradice? Some Men ſay no; for, if he had entred into Paradice, he had already receiv'd the fruition of Happineſs promiſed to the Saints: And that none of the Saints hath yet receiv'd this fruition, Paul firmly aſſerts; ſaying, that <hi>None of thoſe who have born Witneſſes to the Faith, have receiv'd the Promiſe;</hi> for God has provided for us, that which is better, that they may not be made perfect without us. Unto whom we An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That the fruition which he promis'd to the Saints, is not reſerv'd in that Paradice, out of which Adam departed, but in the Kingdom of Heaven, whereunto Adam has not yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. The Paradice wherein Adam was, Adam's Eye ſaw, and his Ear heard; as alſo Eve ſaw and heard; but that which is in the Kingdom, no Man has yet ſeen; but after the General Reſurrection, all the Saints ſhall enjoy it, and Adam together with them.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, That in this he ſaid, <hi>to day,</hi> he did not ſpeak of that Friday, that the Thief ſhould then be in Paradice, but concerning the Conſummation (of the World) and they ſay, the very Truth, <hi>to day;</hi> hereunto they ſubjoyn a Coma, and then theſe Words follow, <hi>Thou ſhalt be with me in Paradice;</hi> that is to ſay, at the end of the World; and this is like to that Expreſſion, <hi>In the day thou ſhalt eat the Fruit thereof, thou ſhalt dye;</hi> whereas 'tis certainly known, that he did not dye <hi>that day;</hi> no, not till he ſaw 930 years: But we ſay, that the Soul of the Thief entered into Paradice the ſelf ſame Friday, for it was very congruous he ſhould be admited to ſuch an Entrance; foraſmuch, as it was not from Divine, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celeſtial means, and Inducements, but Human and Natural, that he confeſſed him. When Chriſt died on the Croſs, his Soul only was ſeperated from the Body; for the Divinity was ſeperated, neither from the Soul, or Body; for it was once Supernaturally, and Incomprehenſibly United, to both the Soul and Body; and when the Soul was ſeperated from the Body, the Body was laid in the Sepulcher, and the Soul went
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37030:66"/>directly to Hell in the Inferiour Parts of the Earth, where all Souls from Adam to this time were impriſon'd, and he Preach'd to all the Souls then kept in Cuſtody, as ſaith St. Peter; and all the Souls that believ'd in him, he led, and brought them from Hell, and conducted them, together with the Soul of the Thief, that ſelf ſame day to Paradice, out of which Adam departed; and ſo performed his Promiſe, <hi>he being that day with him in Paradice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thoſe Souls which did not believe in him (as ſome of the Doctors ſay) he left in Hell.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, he brought them thence, and left them in the Air, and that they were Tranſported by the Devils, to the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the habitable world, and there take up their manſion until the General Reſurrection, and from that Friday hitherto, every Soul departing from the Body, if it be juſt, goeth accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Angeſs to paradiſe, but if it be evil, the Devils carry it to the utmoſt bounds of the habitable World.</p>
               <p>Furthermore to thoſe who were alive athis coming into the fleſh he preached in his own perſon; and to thoſe who were before his coming, <hi>that is to ſay,</hi> from Adam til his Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into Hell, he preached in Hell; and to thoſe after his coming, by the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts. This Hell is a ſtrait and dark Priſon, placed in the lower-moſt parts of the Earth, and it is the Priſon of all Souls; and becauſe the Souls there could not plainly ſee the Divinity, a Soul Cloathed with the Divinity of God, <hi>the Word,</hi> went thither, and ſet up his Light, and Preach'd to Souls, and Releaſed, and brought away all thoſse Souls which he knew, by his Omniſcient foreknowledg, to be capable of Mercy; he brought away the Souls of them, who would have believed in him, had he been Revealed in their time; and conducted them, together with the Soul of the Thief, into Paradice; and when he Preached to the Souls, they had Reaſon, Underſtanding, Conſideration, Memory, Cogitation, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and with theſe Repentance alſo, without which, his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had been in vain; and there was confirmed on them, a New Gift, <hi>That out of the Body they ſhou'd be Condemned, or Juſtified;</hi> the like whereof had not been, nor ſhallbe.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:37030:66"/>
               <p>And when his Body was placed among the Dead, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies alſo were ſenſible of his Power, as John was ſenſible there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the Womb; and thoſe who believ'd in him, there he Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified; wherefore (as we ſaid) he Preached Life in his own Perſon, <hi>to theſe,</hi> and to thoſe who were to be born, by his Apoſtles, and to thoſe who were departed by himſelf. The which he, as Clothed with the Divinity, performed; and even as he was clothed with a Body, and ſpake with Men; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not able otherwiſe on Earth to ſee him; ſo in Hell, becauſe the Souls cou'd not ſee him, he was Clothed with a Soul, and Preached unto them; and even as on Earth he performed Miracles and Wonders, and ſome believed in him, and ſome not; ſo in Hell, he exhibited unto them a great Light, and of thoſe <hi>Souls,</hi> ſome believed in him, and ſome not; and this St. Peter confirms, that <hi>he alſo Preached unto the Dead, that they might be Condemned, or Judged, as alive in the Fleſh;</hi> and from the time his Soul departed from his Body, till it was United to it, it was in <hi>Hell,</hi> the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity being United with the Soul and Body, as we have ſaid: Now, the Miracles which he performed in Hell were theſe; <hi>He hound Satan, looſed the Impriſoned Souls, and made his Light ſhine in the Bowels thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, We have ſaid, That the Devil before Chriſt was Crucified, might have Repented; but foraſmuch, as he did not Repent, it is Written, that he is Tormented. So many Souls have hardned themſelves in Hell, and have not Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for which Cauſe they remain'd there.</p>
               <p>Again, The Thief asked a Kingdom, which is manifeſt from his Petition; <hi>Remember me my Lord in thy Kingdom;</hi> but Chriſt gave Paradice unto him, becauſe as yet none of the Saints had receiv'd the Kingdom. Furthermore, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Hell are referv'd, as Rewards for the Good and Bad; and, neither on that Friday, or as yet, is that Reward come; but it is a time of Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was the third Hour when they Crucified him.</hi> It is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in the firſt place, to know in what hour our Lord was Crucified; whether in the Third, or Sixth Hour, as the other
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37030:67"/>vangeliſt ſay, That on the Sixth Hour, Pilate ſate on the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, in a place called the <hi>Pavement,</hi> and ſaid to the Jews; <hi>Behold your King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some ſay, That he was Crucified at the Sixth Hour, and that Mark was not preſent at the Crucifixion, but wrote what he had heard from his Maſter Peter. Others, with whom we agree, ſay, that he was Crucified at the third hour, as Mark ſaith, and it is manifeſt from what Mathew and Luke have ſaid, That there was Darkneſs at the <hi>Sixth Hour,</hi> until the <hi>Ninth;</hi> for this, that they divided his Garments, and the Title of his Death written, and the Soldiers offer'd him Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, Blaſphemed againſt him; and the Words of the Thieves were between the Sixth and the Third Hours, and from the <hi>Sixth</hi> to the <hi>Ninth,</hi> Darkneſs prevailed; and there was not opportunity for the doing of theſe things, wherefore Mark ſpeaks the Truth, In the Morning, our Lord was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; at the third Hour he was Crucified; and from the Sixth Hour to the Ninth, there was Darkneſs: Moreover, John did not deſign, to ſpeak preciſely of the time of the Crucifixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but after he had made a Relation, as his Fellows had done, and wrote what he had particularly receiv'd from them. He ſaid plainly, (not exactly) <hi>it was about the Sixth Hour, when theſe things were done;</hi> That is to ſay, theſe Words were to the Miracle of the Darkneſs, and the things performed, and not to the time. Again, we ſay, That Chriſt was Crucified for Adam; and the Second Adam agrees directly with the Firſt; and its moſt certain, That Adam was created in the Morning, and by Divine Appointment, began to impoſe Names on the Wild Beaſts, Cattle and the Fowl of the Air, from the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the third Hour; then there paſſed three Hours; and then he caſt on him a Sleep; and framed Eve of his <hi>Rib;</hi> and at the time of the third Hour, they were both placed in Paradice, and receiv'd the Commandment, and at the very time of the <hi>third Hour</hi> our Lord was Crucified, and the time of the ſixth hour they Tranſgreſſed the Commandment, and were Naked, and Clothed themſelves with Darkneſs; ſo on the Sixth Hour, when our Lord was ſtrip'd Naked on the Croſs, Darkneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and the Creatures were Clothed with Darkneſs.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:37030:67"/>
               <p>Others are of opinion, That the third hour whereof Mark ſpeaks, is thus to be underſtood; <hi>Viz.</hi> That Judgment was pronounced againſt him, that he entred into the Praetorium, and was examined until the <hi>Sixth Hour,</hi> and then was Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, That this which John ſaith; <hi>Viz.</hi> The <hi>Sixth Hour,</hi> proceeded from the Error of the firſt Tranſcriber, by Reaſon of the nearneſs in ſimilitude of Characters, between the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>ſixth</hi> Letter of the Alphabet; That is to ſay, of <hi>Gamma</hi> and <hi>Epſilon; Gamma</hi> being written thus Γ, and <hi>Epſilon</hi> thus Ε; Γ therefore ſignifieth <hi>three;</hi> whereunto being added to the back a ſtroak at the bottom, it became <hi>Epſilon,</hi>

For that on this day Adam was created, therein Tranſgreſſed the Commandment, receiv'd Judgment, and on this day departed Paradice; and on the ſelf ſame Hour, that the Cherubim took up the Sword to Guard the Tree, was Chriſt Wounded with the Spear, and diſarmed the Cherub; and in the very hour that Adam went out of Paradice, did our Lord bring the Soul of the Thief into Paradice; and the New Adam Corrected the Old Adam.</p>

Therefore Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Magdalen was another, and was called <hi>Magdalen,</hi> from the Tower which ſhe built her ſelf, out of what ſhe got by playing the Strumpet, as the Work of this Uncleaneſs; and they call
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37030:68"/>her ſeven Devils, the ſulfilling of Unclean Affections; ſhe by her Converſion, figured the Converſion of the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, ſhe was Tempted by Unclean Devils, and not by the Unclean Paſſions of Impudicity. They were called Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; either for that they were Seven in Number, or by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Aſperity of the Temptation; and when our Lord-Cured her, ſhe improved in a Virtuous Converſation, ſo far, as that ſhe was called <hi>Magdalen,</hi> from the Tower of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which ſhe built for her ſelfe, which ſhe mounted to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>Euſebius ſaith, there were two <hi>Magdalens,</hi> the one was ſhe out of whom he drove ſeven Devils, the ſelf ſame of whom thou haſt heard ſay'd, <hi>Come not near me.</hi> And the other was ſhe of whom Mathew ſay'd that ſhe was of <hi>Magdala, Mary of James,</hi> to diſtinguiſh him from James the Son of <hi>Alphoeus</hi> whom he calls <hi>Great,</hi> becauſe he was reckon'd among the Twelve; this was called the <hi>Leſs,</hi> for that he was of the Seventy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſay'd to the Diſciple behold thy Mother, and Woman behold thy Son:</hi> Hereby he teacheth, us to have a care of (and affection for) our Parents to the end of our Lives, eſpecially if they bring us nearer to God, but if they bring us farther from him, we are not to own them; according to that, <hi>Whoſoever doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. He calls Mary the Mother of John, and John her Son, that by theſe Names he might mutually unite them to one another in Love, as Mother and Son.</p>
               <p>At what time did Chriſt recommend his Mother to John? Some ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When he hung on the Croſs; others ſay, When they led him away to be crucified, when the Women wept, at which time ſeeing his <hi>Mother</hi> among them, he committed her to him, altho' it be not written in its proper place.</p>

                  <hi>They filled a ſpunge with Vinegar, and put it on Hyſſop, and ſet it to his Mouth, and they put it on a Reed:</hi> That which is here rendred <hi>Spunge,</hi> is <hi>Sea-Wool,</hi> this they dipped in Vinegar, whereof it receiv'd abundantly; and they put it to his Mouth that he might ſuck thereat and drink; for <hi>Hyſſop</hi> is a Plant or Tree growing in Paleſtine, from the top whereof ſprout out ſmall ſhoots like ſingers round about; and it is very convenient
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37030:69"/>whereon to put any thing; this the Executioners brought with them, and tied it to the end of a Cane, and filled a Spunge with Vinegar, and put it on this Hyſſop, and put it to his Mouth to drink.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, That they called <hi>Zupa</hi> a certain kind of Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, which they put and bound to the top of a Cane, and they put within it (that is to ſay on the top of it) a Spunge full of Vinegar and Gall, and ſo reach'd it out.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, That <hi>Zupa</hi> is like a certain Gourd which is bound to the top of a Cane, and therewith conveys Water from place to place, for they put a Spunge, as aſoreſaid, on this Gourd, and lifted it up with a Cane, and ſo put it to his Mouth.</p>
               <p>There is a Root called <hi>Zupa</hi> and is like to a Mandrake, and contains Blood in its Leaves. Others ſay, That <hi>Zupa</hi> was ſome bitter thing which they pounded and ſtrew'd upon a Spunge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat with Vinegar, and ſo gave it him to drink: For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they gave him Vinegar in a Spunge, becauſe his Hands were bound, and fix'd with Nails; and he that was ſo crucified, could not hold a Cup in his hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>From the Sixth Hour there was Darkneſs over all the Earth, until the Ninth Hour:</hi> That the Jews might underſtand that it was he who cauſed Darkneſs in Egypt; for there was Darkneſs when the Legal Paſſover was to be ſacrificed, and here was darkneſs, when Chriſt was ſacrificed on the Croſs, and to ſignifie that it was the Creator of all things who was Crucified, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Creatures contracted their Light, that the Prophecy of Zachary might be fulfilled; <hi>The Sun ſhall grow dark at Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the Covering of the Sun; at what time is it? In the ſpace, from the twentieth of the Moon, until the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth, the Sun may be Darkned. 'Tis true, that on the thirti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the Sun may be Darkned on the day, whereon they both meet under one point; and altho it happen, that the Sun is but once totally Eclipſed; and yet it is not really Darkned, but appears to us as if it were dark, it being not deprived of Light, nor doth it appear Dark in all places, but in ſome peculiar pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37030:69"/>and this but once a year; for when the Sun happens with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one of thoſe Circles which are called, Darkning Terms, and is placed behind the Moon, and they are in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition under the point. The Moon, being under the Sun, the Sun is ſaid to be Eclipſed. The Moon when it is darkned, the cauſe thereof is, That it hapneth in the <hi>Circle, or Darkning Limit,</hi> and the ſhadow of the Earth; that is to ſay, its extenſion does not permit the Light of the Sun, to Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate that part of the Circle, wherein the Moon at that time holds its Courſe, and it is obſcur'd immediately; and after it paſſeth that place, it borrows Light from the Sun.</p>
               <p>But at the Crucifixion of our Lord, the matter of Fact was contrary; for the Moon was ſo far from being in Conjunction with the Sun, that it was diſtant from it, the ſpace of half the Sphear, which was the ſpace of the Suns Courſe, which it runneth in an hundred and eighty days, and ſixty five Minutes, and fifteen degrees, that is to ſay, Days, and half the Zodiack.</p>
               <p>And this was an Indication of the Majeſty of him who was Crucified; and that it was the Lord of Lights who was Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, they therefore contracted themſelves: And this at the time of Chriſt's being Crucified, had three properties, which are ſtrange to Reaſon.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, That it was at Full Moon.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, That it remained three hours.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, That it ſpread over he whole Earth; ſo that all the Grecian &amp; Chaldean Philoſophers wrote, That one of the Trinity fuffer'd that day; and this is the meaning of what David wrote.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Kings of the Earth Aroſe;</hi> That is to ſay, from their Thrones, and wonder'd at the Miracle which was then wrought, for this Darkneſs was like to that which was in the beginning of the Creation, the whole Creation being Clothed with <hi>Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> for its Lord. The Heavens became Clothed with Cypreſs, and the Moon grew Red as Blood; and tho' it was not the time of its Birth, it appear'd <hi>de novo</hi> in the Eaſt, it ran (for fear) to the Weſt, and there was in Conjunction with the Sun, and both of them ſate in Sadneſs, as good Servants who are fellow-Sufferers with their Lord.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:37030:70"/>
               <p>Again, it is certain, That this Darkneſs at the time of his Crucifiction was not an Eclipſe, as is evident by theſe Tokens.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, An Eclipſe does not continue three Hours, as did this Darkneſs.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, An Eclipſe never is over the whole Earth, as was this Darkneſs.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, An Eclipſe of the Sun happeneth on the 30th of the Moon, but this Darkneſs was the 15th of the Month; the Sun being diſtant from the Moon the whole extent of its Courſe; That is to ſay, an hundred and eighty days, and ſtood oppoſite in the diviſion of the Sphear of the Firmament. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Darkneſs of the Sun and Moon, and the Natural Cauſe of their being ſo, we have largely diſcours'd in the book of our Epiſtle which we made, wherein Faith is Treated of, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Natures of things Intellectual and Senſitive, which is Intituled, <hi>The Book of Reſolutions.</hi>

                  <hi>And about the Ninth Hour Jeſus cryed, Elohi Elohi,</hi> which is Interpeted in the Syrian Language, <hi>God, God, wherefore,</hi> as ſaid St. Mark.</p>
               <p>The Arians ſay, That the <hi>Son</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> ſpoke this, as of his own perſon, with regard to the Father. But the Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and Calcedonians ſay, That the <hi>Son of Man</hi> who was Crucified, ſpoke this, in reſpect of God who dwelt in him, or in regard of the Divine Nature, which departed from him at the time of the Paſſion. But we ſay, that <hi>Jeſus the Son of God</hi> was he who cryed out in theſe Words. The ſame whom Mark deſcribes in the beginning of his Goſpel. <hi>The biginning of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God;</hi> and at whom the Devils exclaimed, <hi>What have we to do with thee Jeſus, thou Son of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For as he was not born for himſelf, but for us; and was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Baptiz'd, Tempted, nor ſuffered Hunger for himſelf, but for us, and in our ſtead; ſo this, that he cryed to the Father <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lohi Elohi,</hi> was for us, and in our Perſons. For if he took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the Perſon of Adam, and came to pay his Debt, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved him to Cry, and Speak as in the Perſon of Adam; and it is evident, that he did cry, as in the Perſon of Adam, and of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37030:70"/>us, becauſe he ſaid afterwards in the Pſalm, <hi>Thou haſt departed far from me, my Redeemer, by reaſon of my Offence;</hi> for he had no Offence, and he ſaid, <hi>I have purged the World, and who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns me of Sin;</hi> and Iſaiah ſaid, <hi>He hath not committed Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor was Guile found in him;</hi> wherefore he cryed in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, who ſaw into what condition we were fallen.</p>
               <p>Moreover, The Son therefore expoſtulates with the Father, <hi>My God, my God, wherefore haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> That what is written in that Pſalm might appear to us to have been ſpoken in the Perſon of the Father, <hi>Therefore I have forſaken thee that thou mighteſt ſuffer and be crucified, that all the ends of the World may remember and be converted to the Lord;</hi> and the Lord ſaid; <hi>By his Stripes we are healed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, Becauſe he is like unto us in all things except Sin; for he was hungry, and thirſty, was weary, and ſlept: He asked, <hi>How many Loaves?</hi> And, <hi>Where have ye put Lazarus?</hi> As if He who knew all things before they were, could be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
               <p>Moreover, He cried to the Father, to ſhew that it was he only who ſuffered, and not the Father nor the holy Ghoſt; for the whole Trinity was not born, becauſe the Son was born of a Virgin; nor did it ſuffer, for that the Son ſuffered theſe things in his Perſon; neither for that he was equal to the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Spirit;</hi> for neither did the Father and Spirit ſuffer theſe things which the Son ſuffered in his Perſon; for theſe things he received in Separation from them, and not in equality with them; not as God, but as he was Man.</p>
               <p>But ſome object, <hi>How was the Son forſaken of the Father, whereas he ſaith,</hi> I am in the Father, and the Father in me?</p>
               <p>We Anſwer, That as he is in the Father, ſo is he in us, as he himſelf ſaid, <hi>I am in you and you in me, that we may be together perfect;</hi> for he is in the Father by reaſon of coequality of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and he is in us by Incorporation with us; and it is certain as to the firſt, the Father did not forſake him, tho' as to the laſt he did forſake him, for he was impaſſible and immortal, the Son remained in his nature as did the Father; but as to the Perſon, he left it to ſuffer and to dye, that he might be like unto us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37030:71"/>for he ſuffered and died as he was Man, remaining impaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and immortal as he was God.</p>
               <p>Again, he cried, <hi>Elohi, Elohi,</hi> that the wickedneſs of thoſe who crucified him might be revealed, and that Satan and Death might believe that he was ſlain.</p>
               <p>Moreover, That the Son ſaid <hi>Elohi, Elohi,</hi> it was in Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Admiration, and not by way of Interrogation, Perſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Doubt.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Againſt the Neſtorians, who ſay, <hi>That the Man who was crucified, ſaid,</hi> God, God, <hi>in reſpect of God who dwelt in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we reply, Sirs, The Man who was Crucified was crucified either willingly, or was led by conſtraint of the <hi>Word;</hi> if wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, wherefore was the Word to be blamed for forſaking him, or departing from him? But if he was conſtrained by the Word, there was in truth an occaſion to cry out and ſay to him who forſook him, <hi>Wherefore haſt thou led me to ſuffer, and haſt now forſaken me? In wonders thou haſt been near unto me, and in my paſſion thou haſt left me; I was thy Miniſter in what concern'd thee, and thou haſt not accompanied me in my Concerns.</hi> God the Word ſeemed as weak, and as a Prevaricator; weak, as that he did not bear the Sight of the Croſs, but forſook him and fled; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, for that he miniſtring to him in Miracles, he did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter help unto him at the time he ſuffer'd the paſſions of his Nature; Man alſo ſeemed to be more powerful than the Word, for he ſuſteined the paſſions, whileſt the other forſook him and departed; he appeared alſo as forſaken, for that he finiſh'd the former tranſactions of his Life by him, and had no help admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto him at his Paſſion and Death, but was left to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And if he were Man who was crucified, and ſaid, <hi>God, God,</hi> it did not behove him to confeſs the Divinity of him who forſook him. And if they ſhall ſay, That <hi>He</hi> left him, becauſe he was in his Nature impaſſible, they may take notice that therefore they own him impaſſible, even whilſt he remained under Paſſion; as the Adamantine Stone, which is tried chiefly in this to be impaſſible, and not to be broken with Iron, when they hammer it without doing hurt thereunto; in like manner
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37030:71"/>a Tule-ſtone is proved to be capable of no prejudice by Water, when being ſteeped in Water it is not diſſolv'd; and a Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander is known to be uncapable of prejudice by Fire, when it is put into Fire, and extinguiſheth it: Moreover, it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, nor incloſure which conſerve God from harm, but his Nature; for he is naturally and highly exalted above Death; for he whom Place or Incloſure conſerve from ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, is continually in Fear, and ſubjected to Paſſions. And if he ſuffer'd with him in Hunger, Thirſt and Labour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did he not ſuffer with him on the Croſs? and if they ſhall ſay, That at thoſe times <hi>He</hi> permitted him to be Tempted with thoſe Paſſions, they may take notice, that it is not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that he was forſaken, ſave only here, when he ſaid, <hi>God, God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, if it were, That he ſhould not ſuffer with him, it proves him paſſible, becauſe he did not leave his former Paſſions, but was paſſible; for an Angel fears not Death, as being Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; much leſs, the Lord of Angels, and God who is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, and goeth not from place to place; for <hi>He</hi> is God, and did not in Will depart from the Father; nor did <hi>He</hi> real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depart from Man, which is manifeſt from hence, that he darkned the Sun; cleſt the Rocks, and Raiſed the Dead, which was the meer work of God: Furthermore, Had he not known wherefore he was forſaken (as ye ſay) then had the Prophets been more priviledg'd, than he, who Propheſied of his Paſſion, and knew that he was to be Crucified and to dye; but it is certainly known, that he is greater than the Prophets (as ye have ſaid) and were it true, that he had not known where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was forſaken, then was it falſe which was written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, that he is the Wiſdom of the Father; and if he knew not then, neither did the Father know; for he ſaid, <hi>As the Father knoweth me, ſo know I the Father;</hi> but if ye ſhall ſay, That the fear of Death hinder'd him from knowing his Death, let them take notice, That it hath not been written, either of the Martyrs or Prophets who ſuſtained Paſſions, that they were hindered ſo, that they cou'd not know of their Death.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:37030:72"/>
               <p>Now let us reprove the Arians, who ſay, That it was the <hi>Son</hi> who was forſaken of his <hi>Father.</hi> Againſt whom we ſay, How did he forſake him? Since that the Son himſelf ſaid, <hi>I am in my Father, and my Father in me;</hi> and whether did he depart, who is every where without Limitation? And how did the Father forſake his Power, and his Wiſdom ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly? For behold, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, That <hi>Chriſt is the Power and Wiſdom of God the Father;</hi> for as he ſpoke this, <hi>I thirſt,</hi> for two Cauſes,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, That he might fulfil the Prophecy, (as ſaid the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts;</item>
                  <item>And Secondly, That he might give us Drink who were Thirſty; and as he asked Water of the <hi>Samaritan Woman,</hi> not in behalf of himſelf, but to induce her to ask Water of Life from him, for behold, it is not written, that he drank of the Waters which he asked of her; which is evident from hence, that as ſoon as ſhe perceiv'd him, ſhe began to demand of him Living Waters; and behold, it is not Written, That he drank of the Waters which he asked of her; wherefore he asked it, not for any other end, but that he was willing to confer on her the Drink of Life. So when he ſaid to the Jews, <hi>I thirſt,</hi> he ſought to give us Water of Life. Moreover, he ſaid, <hi>I thirſt</hi> in reſpect of his Human Nature, which <hi>Thirſted,</hi> after the knowledg of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> for as he demanded in the matter of her who was Healed; <hi>Who touched me,</hi> when the multitude preſſed upon him; that by the asking of a Queſtion, the Faith of her may be Revealed who touched him; ſo here, he asks, <hi>Why haſt thou forſaken me,</hi> not that he was Ignorant, but that the Auditory hearing this Interrogation, might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and be informed, that it was not <hi>He</hi> who was forſaken, but the <hi>Human Nature.</hi>

               <p>Moreover, He calls the Father his God, becauſe <hi>He</hi> was Man; for as he was not to be Blamed or Reprehended when he exercis'd Divine Function becauſe he was God; ſo was he not to be Reproved or Contemned when he ſpake as a Man, foraſmuch as he was a Man.</p>

                  <hi>And one of them ran and brought a Spunge, and filled it with Vinegar;</hi> For he was a Jew who offered him Vinegar and Myrrh, as is evident from hence, that the Jews ſaid, <hi>Behold he calls Elias.</hi> They many times offered him Vinegar in deriſion, and he drank, but here he did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Jeſus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the Ghoſt;</hi> that is to ſay, he ſhewed that voluntarily and freely he gave up his Soul, and not by conſtraint, for he diſmiſſed it; and it was not taken from him, as ours, which is taken by force: It is ſaid of us Creatures, <hi>Thou takeſt their Spirit, and they die;</hi> but he was Creator, and did give it up of his own free will.</p>
               <p>Some Men ask of what kind of Death died our Lord? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that of ours, or of his own? And we anſwer, That ours is the Separation of the Soul from the Body, but the death of God is the Separation of the Divinity from the Humanity, and this he did not ſuffer, wherefore we ſay that he died our death; for his Soul was ſeparated from his Body, and not his Divinity from his Humanity: For tho' his Soul was ſeparated when he died on the Croſs, till he aroſe from the Grave, yet his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was not at all ſeparated, neither from his Soul nor from his Body, for his Divinity was united to his Soul and to his Body, with an unſeparable Union, that is to ſay his Divinity to his Humanity, for his Divinity remained with the Body, and with the Soul went into Hell, and preached to the Souls there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, which did not obey the preaching of Noah, as Peter ſay'd in the <hi>Acts:</hi> for the Divinity is unlimitted, and therefore with his Body and Soul, and by him are all things, and without him nothing, and within him are all things: we ſay alſo of Chriſt that he was God, for it is ſay'd of the word of God, that it is <hi>God</hi> and the very ſame is Man who is God.

Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen in ſaying, <hi>Chriſt, into thy hands I commit my Spirit,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd <hi>Chriſt accept of my Spirit.</hi> From Adam to this time the Souls of the Righteous and of the wicked were ſent to Hell, as we have ſay'd before, and from the time that Chriſt cried, <hi>Father into thy hands I commit my Spirit,</hi> until the end of the World, <hi>the Souls of the Righteous are in the hands of God,</hi> as Solomon ſaid; that is to ſay, they are near unto him, and dwell in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He bowed his Head, and gave up his Spirit:</hi> With us, firſt the Soul departs from us, and afterwards our Heads fall down; but with Chriſt it was not ſo; but firſt he bowed his Head, and preſently <hi>gave up his Soul;</hi> that is to ſay, of his own accord and free will he delivered it up, and not by conſtraint.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, In ſaying, <hi>I lay down my Spirit,</hi> he ſheweth that after a ſhort time he was to take it up again; according as he ſaid, <hi>I lay down my Life that I may take it up again; I have power to lay it down, and to take it up:</hi> For the Spirit is called Soul: For the Soul is called by three Names, <hi>Soul, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> as we have writlen in our Book of Diſtinctions concerning Natures Intellectual and Senſitive.</p>
               <p>It behoves us therefore to enquire how on the Friday, and at the ſame time, was our Lord in theſe three places, in the heart of the Earth, as he ſaid, <hi>The Son of Man ſhall be in the heart of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:37030:73"/>Earth;</hi> and in Paradiſe, as he ſaid to the Thief, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe;</hi> and in the hands of the Father, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, <hi>Into thy hands I commit my Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Immediately the Preface to the Gate of the Temple was rent.</hi> The Preface to the Gate he calls the Curtain which hung be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gate of the Temple, which is called a <hi>Veil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why was the Veil of the Gate rent? Becauſe the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit departed thence, who dwelt there in the Myſteries of the Law.</p>
               <p>But in what manner was it rent? They ſay, That this Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Veil was on the one ſide, and the Woof on the other, which was wonderful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was rent;</hi> That is to ſay, The Veil was divided, for that it could not ſuffer the Paſſion of him who was principally ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified thereby; and to ſignifie that the Grace of the holy Ghoſt was departed thence, and that the Sacrifices of the Law ceaſed, and that it was deſigned for Deſtruction: And after the Ninth hour, the Darkneſs was diſperſed, in token that the Ancient Sorrows which came by Sin were to ceaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Earth was moved,</hi> as a Diſh in the Water. In the firſt place forbidding the Diſputation of the Arrogant, it is to be conſidered that it was eſtabliſhed on a Foundation of Immobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and that an Earthquake was never over all the Earth, and at once; yet this motion was in all the Earth, and the whole Body thereof was moved as a Diſh in the midſt of the Water: So alſo this Darkneſs was over all the Earth, and not one part thereof only, as it is wont to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Stones were Cleft;</hi> that it might be known that it was the Creator who was Crucified, and it was known from hence that the Creatures Suffer'd in Compaſſion with him. Moreover the Rocks were cleft, in reproach to obdurate hearts for all this odious Deed. Moreover, becauſe Rational Creatures were ſilent out of crafty Policy, the Stones Cryed out, and this is meant by thoſe words, If theſe ſhould by ſilent, the Stones would cry out. Again, becauſe God many times inſtructs men for their Converſion by Irrational and Inſenſitive Creatures, as he inſtructed <hi>Baalam</hi> by an <hi>Aſs,</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> by an <hi>Altar,</hi> and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:37030:74"/>
                  <hi>Aſhes,</hi> and <hi>Pharoe</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> by the <hi>Elements.</hi> So he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the Earth out of it's place, and cleft the Rock, in Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Jews, who he deſired might have been converted from their wickedneſs, and they would not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Sepulchers were open'd, and many Bodies;</hi> That is to ſay, Aroſe on the Ninth hour of <hi>Friday,</hi> and they were not of thoſe who were dead long before, but ſuch as fell aſleep about three years, more or leſs before the Paſſion of our Lord; and they were Saints, becauſe they believed in our Lord before their Death; And they were of Jeruſalem, and aroſe out of the Sepulchers round about the City, and enter'd into Jeruſalem, and were known, ſome to their Fathers, ſome to their Brethren, and ſome to their Mothers, and reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, ſaying, <hi>What wicked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eed is this which ye have done, that ye have Crucified the Life, and the Giver of Life;</hi> and they remained there three days Eating nothing, but were preſerv'd by Divine Efficacy as was Moſes and Elias in their Faſting, and their Bodies were really United to their Souls; and concerning this, Mathew ſaid, <hi>That many Bodies of the Saints Aroſe, and abode three days in Jeruſalem, and there Preached, and afterwards returned unto their Sepulchers and fell aſleep; but did not go into Paradice, neither were they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed to the utmoſt Limits, nor were they ſeen of all Men.</hi> And it is certain from what Mathew ſaid, <hi>That they appeared unto many, for many are not all;</hi> and ſo our Lord after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was not always ſeen, but ſometimes, and that not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every one, as at firſt, but to his Diſciples, and to thoſe who were Worthy. Others ſay, That they were Prophets who knew the Holy Scriptures, and believed in him before their Deceaſe (as ſaith Ignatius) and had Preached the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt and their own, the Dead aroſe in manifeſtation of this Raiſer from the Dead. <hi>Johannes de Dara, The Dead who Aroſe did not enter the City to Preach, until he Aroſe.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, That they remained at their Sepulchers Standing, and giving Praiſes. Others, That they were Aſſembled at the Mount of Olives. Others, That they went into Paradice.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:37030:74"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they went into the Holy City Joruſalem:</hi> Some ſay, That he doth not call this Earthly City which was polluted Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, but that which is in Heaven, and when Chriſt cryed on the Croſs, they were reviv'd and remained in their Graves as Jonas did in the Fiſh; and after his Reſurrection, they alſo Aroſe Spiritually, and when he Aſcended in <hi>abſcondito</hi> to his Father in the Heavens, they alſo Aſcended privately with him to the Holy City which is in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, That Jeruſalem, as to the Upper part thereof, was Holy, and that many believing Perſons dwelt there, but that the Lower Part was Prophane, by Reaſon of the Deceit practis'd there, and he calls the Upper Region thereof, the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly City,</hi> whereunto the Dead who Aroſe, Entred, and Preached to the Believers who Lamented his Death.</p>
               <p>Others, That he calls by the Name of Jeruſalem the whole Terreſtrial City, into which they Entred, and Preached; and more then 500 Souls returned to their Bodies, and Entred, and appeared to many; and they appeared to the Grief of thoſe who knew not that they had Crucified their Lord, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſpake to them who were bitterly griev'd in Spirit.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, That they at firſt appear'd in <hi>Gallilee,</hi> and in many other places, and that after the Reſurrection they came to Jeruſalem and appear'd to many, that they might declare, that the Reſurrection was no Phantaſm. There were five Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles when Chriſt was Crucified, whereof ſome were in the <hi>Heavens,</hi> ſome in the Air, ſome on the Earth, and ſome under the Earth. In the Heavens, the Sun and Moon were Darkned, in the Air the Veil was Rent, on the Earth the Rocks were Cleft<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from under the Earth the Dead Aroſe; and ſome of the Miracles were Univerſal, as that of the Eclipſe of the Sun, and the Emotion of the Earth, ſome alſo were particular, as that the Rocks and Veil were Rent, and the Dead Aroſe.</p>
               <p>Who therefore was he who hung upon the Croſs? God, or Man? If he were God, it were impoſſible that the Nails ſhould be fix'd in his Hands, and a Spear in his Side, for his Nature was higher than to receive ſuch Impreſſions; and if he were but meer Man, who was it that wrought Miracles, who dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:37030:75"/>the Sun, Rent the Rocks, and Raiſed the Dead? For all theſe things by meer Man could not be effected; wherefore it was God Incarnate who hung on the Croſs, and did theſe things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Centurion and thoſe with him who had the Cuſtody of Jeſus:</hi> From ſomewhat which the Centurion and they who were with him ſaw, they were frighted, and being conſtrained by fear, they did confeſs that he was the Son of God. Luke ſaith, <hi>Truly this was a Juſt Man,</hi> and both were true; and the one of them Mathew wrote, and Luke the other.</p>
               <p>But whence was it that the Centurion, and they with him, knew that <hi>he was the Son of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Either from Chriſt himſelf when he taught, or from the Jews who accuſed him, ſaying, <hi>He made himſelf the Son of God:</hi> And by adding the word <hi>Truly,</hi> he confirm'd that he was Naturally the Son of God, for ſo he was not meer Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They returned ſtriking their Breſts;</hi> That is to ſay, that they might free themſelves from the iniquity of them who crucified him, crying out, <hi>God forbid that we ſhould partake of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Blood;</hi> and that they might ſhew the audacious iniquity of the Jews. Theſe Multitudes were they who aſſembled from all parts to be there at the Feaſt of the Paſſover.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There were there many Women:</hi> Obſerve the infirm Sex of Women, how it appeared more couragious than Men; for they adhered unto him even in the midſt of Perils and Paſſions, and therefore obſerved all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That theſe Bodies might not lodge on their Croſſes:</hi> The Law commanded that Bodies ſhould not remain on Croſſes, and therefore the Jews ſhew'd their care for the Honour of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, that it might be obſerv'd, and not prophaned, and that their Law might be kept: Wherefore they petitioned Pilate that their Thighs might be broken, and they might take them down from the Croſſes before the Approach of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Soldiers asked leave of Pilate, and they brake the Thighs of the firſt and of the ſecond, becauſe they were not yet dead; but when they came to Jeſus, and ſaw that he was already
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37030:75"/>dead, they brake not his thighs, that this Prophecy might he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, A Bone of him ſhall not be broken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here Chriſt did not continue to the term of Humane Nature, it being a very great Wonder that he ſhould dye ſo ſoon, and ſo ſpeedily, according to what Mark ſaid, <hi>Pilate wondred that he was ſo ſoon dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But one of the Soldiers ſtruck him on his ſide;</hi> The Spear wherewith he wounded him in the ſide was leſs than a Sword Some ſay that he ſtruck him to try whether he was dead or no; but we ſay that he ſtruck him to pleaſe the <hi>Jews,</hi> as hereafter; and that the ſaying of <hi>Zachary</hi> might be accompliſh'd, <hi>They ſhall look upon him whom they have digged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, He ſtruck him, that <hi>Water and Blood</hi> might iſſue from him, which are the Myſteries of our Redemption, and a true Token of our Faith; Whence the Church hath learned to make Wine and Water the Myſtery of his Blood, and not as the Armenians and others, who celebrate only in Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Moreover Wine and Water deſcended into the Mouth of Adam, for the Croſs of the ſecond Adam was fixed in his Mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he who ſaw it, teſtified:</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>I perceived with mine own Eyes, that when Chriſt was ſtruck with a Spear, there guſhed out Blood and Water; and I did not hear it by relation from others.</hi> This was John the Divine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But when it was Evening:</hi> He calls Evening the time near to the coming in of the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There came a rich Man:</hi> Mathew calls this rich Man Joſeph, but Luke calls him <hi>a good and juſt Man;</hi> John, <hi>a Diſciple of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> one of the Seventy Two; but Mark calls him <hi>Bouleutes,</hi> that is, <hi>a Counſellor,</hi> one of thoſe who give Advice unto Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; <hi>Boule</hi> is expounded Counſel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From Ramath,</hi> where the Children were ſlain by Herod; and Joſeph was of Ramath, and from on high, Life was given to Adam.</p>
               <p>John ſaith, That Nicodemas alſo came and aſſociated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with Joſeph in the Sepulture of Jeſus; that Nicodemus who formerly came to him by Night, and brought an Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Myrrh and Aloes; Aloes is that which we call <hi>Pſabboro</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:37030:76"/>and Myrrh is a Gum ſomewhat black, and like unto Olibanum. <hi>Hatzſo</hi> and <hi>Sedona</hi> ſignify the ſame thing, being a Linnen Cloth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An hundred pound weight:</hi> This abundance of Oyntment was in confutation of the Jews, who ſaid that his Diſciples ſtole him; for how could they ſeparate the Cloaths and the Linnen Cloth, which ſtuck altogether, and afterwards ſet in order the Under-Garment in another place by it ſelf, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared; for this Oyntment uſually daubs the Cloaths of ſuch as are anointed therewith, and is not ſuddenly or eaſily taken off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he put him into a new Sepulcher of his own:</hi> Jacobus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugenſis ſaith, That this Sepulcher did belong unto Joſhua the Son of Nun; and that it was reſerv'd for a Myſtery, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd from one to another unto Joſeph, Others ſay that it was Joſeph's, and that he hew'd it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hew'd in a Rock:</hi> He was laid in a Stone-Sepulcher, and not buried in the Earth; thereby alluding to the Church, which is not to be removed by Floods of iniquity: He was laid there himſelf alone, to ſhew that his Body onely was the Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was laid on the Altar of the Church, giving Life to thoſe who receive him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There was in the place where he was crucified a Garden, and in that Garden a Sepulcher where no man had been laid:</hi> This of the Garden was not Real, but Allegorically ſheweth that he was Reigning in Paradice to cancel the Debt which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in Paradiſe, that is to ſay, a Garden; and that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſhould enter where Sin had entred before.</p>
               <p>And that he was placed in a New Sepulcher, was done as of Divine Providence, firſt, leaſt by the Reſurrection that was made, it might have been pretended to have been of ſome other who had been buried there. Again, as he aroſe from the Virgins Womb without breaking the Seals and Virginity of her who bore him; ſo from his own Virgin Tomb did he ariſe, the Marks, Seals and Stones intire and inviolate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Stone that was on the Sepulcher:</hi> It is reported that this Stone was the ſame with that out of which guſhed Rivers; if it
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37030:76"/>be a truth, let it be received; if not, let the Report go with the Winds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the other Mary who ſat over-againſt the Sepulcher:</hi> That is to ſay, Becauſe they were ſo inflamed with love of him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſat over againſt him. The <hi>other Mary</hi> he calls the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they Reſted on the Subbath as was Commanded;</hi> That is to ſay, they returned, having prepared Sweet Odours, but they came not on the Sabbath, by reaſon the Law commanded they ſhould do no Work on the Sabbath; and therefore they prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Sweet Odours as the Cuſtom was that they might perfume on the third day the Body, for the Love they bore unto it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Morrow after;</hi> That is to ſay, it was the Sabbath day after the Friday, or Preparation.</p>

                  <hi>The Chief Prieſts Aſſembled together;</hi> That is to ſay, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire Pilate to grant them their Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Lord, we Remember that this Deceiver.</hi> They called Pilate Lord, and denied Chriſt; and by the Words, <hi>we Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> they ſhew'd that they knew all things which were ſaid by him. But obſerve, how void of Pride Mathew was, who wrote all Words of Reproach, and was not aſhamed to expreſs the Word <hi>Deceiver,</hi> and others the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Command therefore that they watch the Sepulcher.</hi> They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Watch-Men, becauſe, they were mov'd with his Speech, <hi>That he was to Riſe the Third day.</hi> Secondly, Becauſe the Watch-Men were to be Preachers of the Reſurrection to the Region of the Jews. Pilate ſaid unto them, <hi>Ye have Watches, go and have a Care.</hi> Pilate did not ſend a Guard of his own, nor did he Seal the Sepulcher, that they might not have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſay, That he took a Bribe, and permitted his Diſciples to take him away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they Sealed the Stone, the Soaldiers being preſent.</hi> Some ſay. That they made the Souldiers to ſtand as Centuries at the Stone, and tied them thereunto, and fixed the Impreſſion of their Seals on their Necks, or their Thighs, or their Loyns, or their Feet.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:37030:77"/>
               <p>Others, That they placed them on both ſides of the Stone, with their Faces one againſt the other, and that they ſtretched forth their Hands over the Stone, and knit their Fingers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether about it, and Sealed them.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, That they ſealed the Stone over the Sepulcher, with all their Rings, as did <hi>Darius</hi> the Ciſtern with his Ring, and the Ring of his Nobles: And if they had not ſealed it, and appointed Keepers, they might have a pretence to ſay, that he was ſtoln away; but this fell out more to their Shame, That the Keepers themſelves became Preachers and Witneſſes of the Reſurrection, and that the Seals and Signs gave concurrent Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies with the Keepers that they did not Lye. And he calls Keepers, thoſe who were appointed to keep Priſoners in Cuſtody, or thoſe who were ordained Executioners in Capital Cauſes, and there were 15 Keepers, whereof ſome were He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, and ſome Romans. There were three Captains, and twelve under Command and this is Written in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Roll, and in other Hebrew Hiſtories.</p>

                  <hi>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T in the Evening of the Dawning of the Firſt day of the Week.</hi> Concerning the diverſity of Mens Opinions touching the times, whereof all the Evangeliſts have ſeverally Written, we have ſpoken, but not of the time when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Aroſe, for that is unknown to Angels and Men, but he knows it, and his Father, and the Holy-Ghoſt; Mathew ſaith, <hi>They came in the Evening,</hi> John <hi>in the Morning,</hi> Luke <hi>at the dawning of the Day,</hi> Mark <hi>when the Sun Aroſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Evening of the dawning of the firſt day of the week came Mary Magdalen and Mary the Mother of God, to viſit the Sepulcher, and they were told by an Angel that the Lord was <hi>Riſen,</hi> and they ſaw our Lord and <hi>took hold of his feet,</hi> and he ſent them to tell his Diſciples; but the Keepers went into the City and declared it to the Prieſts, and received a Bribe, and ſaid he is ſtolen away; Mary Magdalen hearing that he was ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſuffer'd ſomewhat of humane Infirmity as did Thomas, and She returned to the Sepulcher the ſecond time, early in the morning when it was dark, as John ſaid, and ſhe ſaw the Stone removed and an Angel ſitting thereon, whom ſhe ſaw in the Evening ſitting on the Stone; then ſhe became more doubtful and came to Symon and John, and ſay'd, <hi>they have taken away
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:37030:79"/>my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him;</hi> and when the Diſciples went and ſaw the Sepulcher, and the Linnin. Cloaths they were aſſured, and returned believing, but Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen ſtayed at the Sepulcher, ſurprized with doubt of what had happned unto him; and when ſhe ſaw two Angels which had not appeared to Symon and John, and when ſhe looked back ſhe ſaw our Lord, and he ſent her-unto his Diſciples, and ſhe returned unto them, and declared unto them, that <hi>She had ſeen our Lord</hi> and ſhe found there thoſe women who came from Gallilee with him, who were prepared to come to the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher with Sweet Odours, and ſhe returned with them, and alſo the mother of God, whom Luke calls the mother of James, and he was beautiful as ſay'd Luke: And they ſaw there two Angels in the Similitude of two Men, and their Garments <hi>Shone,</hi> and their faces were Illuſtrious; there came Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, and the mother of God, with the Forraigner, the Wife of Shalom, who was not in readineſs to come with the other women; and they ſaw an Angel like unto a Young man cloathed with a white Stole, and they wondered, and then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was that the Sun aroſe, as ſayeth Saint Mark. Theſe are the four times that women came to the Sepulcher, as the Evangeliſts wrote; Saint <hi>Severus</hi> reconciled the ſeveral times wherein women are ſay'd to have come to the Sepulcher. Magdalen came five times to the Sepulcher. Firſt, in the Evening as ſaid St. Mathew. Secondly, at the break of day when it was yet dark a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, as ſay'd St. John; and ſhe came unto Symon and John, and it was the third time of her coming with Symon and John; The 4th time ſhe came with John and the mother of James, at the Dawning of the day, as ſay'd Luke, the Fifth time was, when the Sun aroſe with Shalom and the mother of James, as mark ſay'd.</p>
               <p>The mother of God came three times; the firſt time, when he ſaid <hi>the other Mary,</hi> the ſecond time, when Luke ſay'd Mary the Mother of James; The Third time, when Mark ſay'd the mother of James and Joſes: Jacobus Aurienſis calls the other Mary, the firſt Wife of Joſeph who bare James and Joſe, The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarck <hi>Severus</hi> calls <hi>the other Mary</hi> the mother of God, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37030:79"/>likewiſe calls the Virgin Mary the mother of James and Joſe, according to the accuſtom'd Speech.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Symon</hi> went twice to the Sepulcher. Firſt of all with John. Secondly alone, as Luke ſaith, <hi>And he went with his Soul fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Admiration;</hi> and at this time he ſaw, as ſaid the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Houſhold of <hi>Cleophas,</hi> That our Lord was ſurely Riſen, and appear'd unto Symon, as Paul and Luke do Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; Moreover, about the time wherein our Lord Roſe from the Sepulcher, he is to cauſe the General Reſurrection accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Severus,</hi> and that ſuch an hour bears a great Similitude and Image of the laſt Hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in the Evening of the Sabbath at the dawning of the firſt day of the Week;</hi> That is to ſay, we are to enquire of four times, and to diſtinguiſh them one from another, in reference to the Day, the Night, the Morning and the Evening, for theſe four Seaſons the Sun maketh with us, and the Day is the time when the Sun is above the Earth, and the Night is the time when the Sun is below the Earth, or hidden behind the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Mountains, as is the Opinion of ſome, for the Evening is the End of the Day, to wit, the time when the Sun is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure to us, the Morning is the Beginning of the Day when the Sun Beams peep out, and the Night is at an end: That there is an Evening of the preceding day John teſtifies who ſaid, <hi>When it was the Evening of the Firſt day of the Week</hi> which he ſpake of, he doth not call the Evening of the coming in of the Sabbath, but the Evening of its going out, for the Evening of the day is the going out and end thereof, whether it be Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial or Natural; for ſo Moſes ſaid; for after the Light was Created and the Day was ended; and the Hours thereof he ſaid, <hi>it was the Evening and the Morning</hi> calling the Evening the end of the firſt Artificial day which was created, and the Morning the end of the Night, and he doth not call the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sabbath the time of the Sun ſetting of the Sabbath, otherwiſe he had ſaid, in the Evening of the Sabbath and no more; but foraſmuch as he added the Dawning of the firſt day of the Week, to wit, the waxing Light; he ſheweth that he calleth here, the Night of the Firſt Day of the Week the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37030:80"/>of the Sabbath in Reſpect of the Dawning; Much of the time was paſſed, inſomuch, that it was about Cock crowing, that is to ſay, the time when we in Faſting begin to abſtain from Meat and Drink; and we begin at the Firſt, and not at the end of the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Johannes de Dara. And in the Evening of the Sabbath;</hi> That is to ſay, alſo concerning the Paſſover, it is written, that it was ſlain on the 14th in the Evening, for altho it was repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Night of the day to come, by reaſon of the Courſe of the Moon; yet it was reckoned the Evening of the Day, and not of the Night; others ſay that Mathew by the <hi>Evening,</hi> entended the whole Night of the Firſt day of the Week, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Phraſe of the Scripture by a <hi>Synechdoche of the part for the whole,</hi> according to this, <hi>the Evening and the Morning was the Firſt day;</hi> and again, <hi>Let all Fleſh praiſe the Name of the Lord; and the Soul of Iſrael died in the way.</hi> Others, in the Evening of the Sabbath, when the Firſt day of the Week Dawned. Euſebius; Mathew by way of Expoſition adds after this, <hi>of the Evening of the Sabbath the dawning of the Firſt day of the Week,</hi> denoting the Hour and time of the Night after the Sabbath, which was when the Firſt day of the Week dawned. 'Tis true, Mathew wrote in the Hebrew, and he who Tranſlated the Scripture into the Greek Language, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>the Dawning of the Day, the Evening of the Sabbath;</hi> and Mathew, <hi>by the Evening,</hi> means <hi>the whole Length and Evening of the Night;</hi> as John calls the <hi>paſſing away,</hi> or the <hi>leaſt part of the Night, Day;</hi> and therefore adds, whileſt it was yet dark, leaſt it ſhould be thought, that he ſpoke of the Morning; ſo Mathew alſo, when he ſaid, the Evening of the Sabbath, leſt Men might think it was ſpoken of the Evening Seaſon, he adds, <hi>When the Firſt day of the Week began to dawn.</hi>

               </list>
               <p>Mary Magdalen and the Mother of God ſaid nothing to Shalom and John, that they might go and be aſſured by the ſight of the Sepulcher, and of the Angels, and not by their Words: But this, <hi>Who ſhall Roul away for us the Stone,</hi> &amp;c. was ſpoke of John and Shalom; Magdalen therefore and the Mother of God ſaw before the Stone was Rouled away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the other Mary to behold the Sepulcher;</hi> That is to ſay, that they might caſt in Sweet Odours, as was uſual on the third day; and wherefore wou'd they caſt in Sweet Odours; ſome ſay for the Sepulcher, but we ſay for the Body; and it is evident from what Mark ſaid, they bought Aromaticks, that they might go and Anoint <hi>Him</hi> and not his Sepulcher; Again, <hi>who ſhall Roul away for us the Stone?</hi> By the Rouling away the Stone, 'tis clear, that they ſought to caſt Odours on his Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And behold there was a great Earthquake.</hi> It was not here as at the Croſs, for that was an Univerſal Earthquake, but this was particular, and the Keepers and the Women only perceiv'd it, and the Keepers were Terrified, and the Women comforted therewith; and he explains what kind of Earthquake it was, for an Angel of the Lord deſcended from Heaven, drew near and Rouled away the Stone; it was the Angel Gabriel, the ſame who Adminiſtred in his whole Diſpenſation on Earth, and the other who appear'd with him was Michael; he ſaith, that he deſcended from Heaven, and appear'd to the Keepers; becauſe, it is thought that Heaven is their place, though ſome of them be with us in this World, ſuch as are ſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jacobus Sarugenſis</hi> ſaith, That a Fire appear'd to the Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and that a multitude of Angels were heard in the Air; and they ſaw Chriſt face to face, as he came out of the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, uncorrupted, and with that Angel, other Angels Deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a Light ſhone, and a Ladder of Fire was put up that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:37030:81"/>Reach'd from Earth to Heaven; and Chriſt ſtood not above it to Deſcend, but below it to Aſcend; and there were Angels aſcending and deſcending, ſinging Praiſes.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, We ſay that it is unknown to the Creatures at what time our Lord aroſe, but the Evangeliſts have written of the ſeveral times that the Women came to the Sepulcher, as we have ſaid above. Mathew ſaith that Mary came in the evening and ſaw our Lord, and becauſe the Keepers came in the Night, and ſignified that he was riſen, the Prieſts publiſhed by Proclamation that his Diſciples had ſtolen him away; and when it was heard that he was ſtolen away, Magdalen ſuffer'd ſomewhat of humane Infirmity, and ran to the Sepulcher, as John hath written; and afterwards ſhe returned with the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men bringing Aromaticks, as ſaith Luke; and when the Sun aroſe, with John, as Mark hath written, they ſaw ſix Angels at the Sepulcher; Mathew ſaith they ſaw one, Luke ſaith two Angels; John two, Mark one: Firſt of all the Soldiers ſaw that the Lord was riſen, the Seals remaining as they were, and they were terrifyed; and at the time before the Women came, the Angel deſcended, who rolled away the Stone, and for fear of him it was that they who kept him were terrifyed, and became as dead Men, and they ſaw alſo the Angel who ſat upon the Stone, and he was like to Lightning; and that they might not fear, he ſaid unto them meekly, <hi>Be not ye afraid, as are the Keepers;</hi> and after he had encouraged them, he preached unto them the Reſurrection; and when the Women went away, the Keepers were awakened, and haſtily went to the City, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to the High-Prieſt what had hapned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And came near and rolled away the Stone.</hi> He did not roll away the Stone that Chriſt might go forth of the Sepulchor, for he Aroſe before the Angel deſcended, but that the Women who ſaw that he was laid in the Sepulcher perceiving it empty, and he not there, might believe; for he went out of it the Stone being Sealed, and the Impreſſions remaining as they were.</p>
               <p>But how was it poſſible that the Body ſhould go out, the Door being ſhut. We Anſwer, That all things are eaſie and expedite for the Lord to perform, for as he came out of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37030:81"/>Womb, Virginity being preſerv'd, and darkned the Sun; and Rais'd the Dead; and as the Angel came unto Daniel in the Den being Sealed up, and as the Apoſtles got out of Priſon, and Symon walked on the Waves, and the Aegyptian Waters were turned into Blood, and the Hebrews kept ſure footing in the Region of the Sea, and Moſes his Rod was turned into a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ſo he came out the Sepulcher it being Sealed up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And his Countenance was as Lightning.</hi> It is the Cuſtom of Angels to ſhew themſelves in Shapes and Figures according to the ſeveral Works of their Miniſtry; to Joſhua the Son of Nun, and to David they appear'd as Souldiers in <hi>Armour,</hi> to Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Red Colours and Spotted, and to the Women in a comely Shap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and full of Joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Keepers were Terrified for Fear of them.</hi> The Angel appear'd as he pleas'd, to the Women Pleaſing and Splendid, but to the Keepers Angry and Terrible, and all this they ſo much fear'd that they became as Dead Men,</p>
               <p>Wherefore was the Reſurrection firſt manifeſted to the Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers? Becauſe the Jews were more ready to give Credit unto them, than to the Diſciples and to Women. For God is uſed to draw the Perverſe by what they have Relation, or Affinity unto, as by a Star he drew the Wiſe-Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Angel anſwered and ſaid unto the Women.</hi> He did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comfort them with a Joyful Apparition, but with Speech alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fear Ye not.</hi> He ſaid <hi>Ye,</hi> in Compariſon of thoſe who Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him, for Fear belongs to them; but <hi>Ye</hi> are worthy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Luke ſaith, <hi>They Remembred his Words,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>I ſhall Riſe again;</hi> and he Aroſe again, as Mathew ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know that Jeſus who is Crucified;</hi> Not to deride him, as did thoſe who Crucified him, but to Honour him; and if an Angel was not aſhamed to ſay that he was Crucified, how are the Calcedonians and Neſtorians aſhamed to ſay that he was.</p>
